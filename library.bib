abstract = {This report is the first revision to a series of reports on radionuclides inn the SRS environment. Tritium was chosen as the first radionuclide in the series because the calculations used to assess the dose to the offsite population from SRS releases indicate that the dose due to tritium, through of small consequence, is one of the most important the radionuclides. This was recognized early in the site operation, and extensive measurements of tritium in the atmosphere, surface water, and ground water exist due to the effort of the Environmental Monitoring Section. In addition, research into the transport and fate of tritium in the environment has been supported at the SRS by both the local Department of Energy (DOE) Office and DOE's Office of Health and Environmental Research.},

@article{Whyte2000,
abstract = {Accurate pollutant mass budgets are needed for identifying contaminant sources and establishing cleanup goals. We monitored mercury discharges from an abandoned mine site in northern California with the objectives of: (1) estimating the mass loading of mercury from the site; (2) evaluating the factors that control the mercury discharges; (3) assessing the significance of peak flows in transporting contaminants; and (4) developing methods for measuring the effectiveness of cleanup efforts. We sampled water downstream from the mine site over a wide range of streamflows. Mercury concentrations varied over 2000-fold, from 485 to 1040000 ng/l, grossly exceeding the regulatory water quality objective of 12 ng/l at all times. Particulate mercury represented over 99.97\% of the total mercury, and mercury concentrations were closely correlated to suspended sediment concentrations (r = 0.98). Thus, we can use suspended sediment concentrations as a proxy for mercury concentrations, and calculate a continuous record of mercury flux from continuous monitoring of streamflow (using a small flume) and turbidity (using an optical backscatter sensor). Mercury fluxes inferred in this way are consistent with fluxes estimated from field samples. In January and February of 1998, our small abandoned mine site released approximately 82 kg of mercury to downstream waters. Most of the mercury was released during brief intense rainstorms. For example, in one 200-min period we recorded 3.4 cm of rain, a 2.6-fold increase in streamflow (460-1120 l/s), and an 82-fold increase in mercury flux (1.2-99 g/min). Over 75\% of the total mercury flux during this 2-month period occurred in less than 10\% of the total time. In systems such as this one, where contaminant transport is highly episodic, sampling programs that miss the high-flow episodes may greatly underestimate the actual water quality threat. In addition, changes in pollutant fluxes or concentrations in receiving waters may not reflect changes in pollutant sources (such as an environmental cleanup) if the stochastic forcing (e.g. intense rainstorms) varies through time. We propose that water quality trends can be more accurately measured by changes in the relationship between contaminant flux and stochastic driving factors, as expressed by contaminant rating curves.},

@article{Halliday2012,
abstract = {This paper examines two hydrochemical time-series derived from stream samples taken in the Upper Hafren catchment, Plynlimon, Wales. One time-series comprises data collected at 7-hour intervals over 22 months (Neal et al., 2012-this issue), while the other is based on weekly sampling over 20 years. A subset of determinands: aluminium, calcium, chloride, conductivity, dissolved organic carbon, iron, nitrate, pH, silicon and sulphate are examined within a framework of non-stationary time-series analysis to identify determinand trends, seasonality and short-term dynamics. The results demonstrate that both long-term and high-frequency monitoring provide valuable and unique insights into the hydrochemistry of a catchment. The long-term data allowed analysis of long-term trends, demonstrating continued increases in DOC concentrations accompanied by declining SO(4) concentrations within the stream, and provided new insights into the changing amplitude and phase of the seasonality of the determinands such as DOC and Al. Additionally, these data proved invaluable for placing the short-term variability demonstrated within the high-frequency data within context. The 7-hour data highlighted complex diurnal cycles for NO(3), Ca and Fe with cycles displaying changes in phase and amplitude on a seasonal basis. The high-frequency data also demonstrated the need to consider the impact that the time of sample collection can have on the summary statistics of the data and also that sampling during the hours of darkness provides additional hydrochemical information for determinands which exhibit pronounced diurnal variability. Moving forward, this research demonstrates the need for both long-term and high-frequency monitoring to facilitate a full and accurate understanding of catchment hydrochemical dynamics.},

@book{Bea2013a,
abstract = {Acidic low-level waste radioactive waste solutions were discharged to three unlined seepage basins at the F-Area of the Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina, USA, from 1955 through 1989. Despite many years of active remediation, the groundwater remains acidic and contaminated with significant levels of U(VI) and other radionuclides. Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) is a desired closure strategy for the site, based on the premise that regional flow of clean background groundwater will eventually neutralize the groundwater acidity, immobilizing U(VI) through adsorption. An in situ treatment system is currently in place to accelerate this in the downgradient portion of the plume and similar measures could be taken upgradient if necessary. Understanding the long-term pH and U(VI) adsorption behavior at the site is critical to assess feasibility of MNA along with the in-situ remediation treatments. This paper presents a reactive transport (RT) model and uncertainty quantification (UQ) analyses to explore key controls on the U(VI)-plume evolution and long-term mobility at this site. Two-dimensional numerical RT simulations are run including the saturated and unsaturated (vadose) zones, U(VI) and H(+) adsorption (surface complexation) onto sediments, dissolution and precipitation of Al and Fe minerals, and key hydrodynamic processes are considered. UQ techniques are applied using a new open-source tool that is part of the developing ASCEM reactive transport modeling and analysis framework to: (1) identify the complex physical and geochemical processes that control the U(VI) plume migration in the pH range where the plume is highly mobile, (2) evaluate those physical and geochemical parameters that are most controlling, and (3) predict the future plume evolution constrained by historical, chemical and hydrological data. The RT simulation results show a good agreement with the observed historical pH and concentrations of U(VI), nitrates and Al concentrations at multiple locations. Mineral dissolution and precipitation combined with adsorption reactions on goethite and kaolinite (the main minerals present with quartz) could buffer pH at the site for long periods of time. UQ analysis using the Morris one-at-a-time (OAT) method indicates that the model/parameter is most sensitive to the pH of the waste solution, discharge rates, and the reactive surface area available for adsorption. However, as a key finding, UQ analysis also indicates that this model (and parameters) sensitivity evolves in space and time, and its understanding could be crucial to assess the temporal efficiency of a remediation strategy in contaminated sites. Results also indicate that residual U(VI) and H(+) adsorbed in the vadose zone, as well as aquifer permeability, could have a significant impact on the acidic plume long-term mobility.},

@article{Rollins2008,
abstract = {One of the steps that has been taken to expedite the radiation dose reconstruction process is the development of "site profiles." These reports, one of which has been prepared for each of the major U.S. Department of Energy nuclear sites, include detailed assessments of the dose rates at a given site due to on-site exposures. Presented in this paper is a summary of the development of the ambient environmental dose profile for the Savannah River Site (SRS) for specific time periods from 1951-2001. Internal doses were estimated based on the radionuclide concentrations in the atmosphere due to individual facility releases and the resuspension of radioactive materials from the soil. External doses were estimated on the basis of releases of noble gases and contributions from ambient background radiation, which had been elevated due to various on-site activities. Although the annual environmental reports for the SRS served as a major resource for this effort, considerable work was required to access these data in terms of the accompanying dose rates. This was due, for example, to the confounding effects of nuclear weapons testing, lack of spatial and radionuclide resolution, and insensitivity of sampling methods to radionuclides important to dose. To overcome these problems, methods were developed to use well-documented source terms from reports published by others, coupled with historical meteorological records, to estimate specific airborne concentrations for radionuclides such as 3H, 41Ar, 131I, 234U, 235U, 238U, 238Pu, 239Pu, and 240Pu. Airborne concentration calculations included spatial and release height considerations for source terms at eight different production facilities. The resulting estimates then were used to derive annual intakes based on an assumed individual breathing rate of 2,400 m3 y(-1). Annual intakes resulting from resuspension of radionuclides from soil were based on maximum soil concentrations located in appropriate areas. This being accomplished, the estimated intakes and ambient radiation exposures were used to estimate the dose rates to major body organs of interest at specific time intervals.},

abstract = {A number of nuclear technologies developed and applied at the Savannah River Site in support of nuclear weapons material production and environmental remediation can be applied to problems in law enforcement. Techniques and equipment for high-sensitivity analyses of samples are available to identify and quantify trace elements and establish origins and histories of forensic evidence removed from crime scenes. While some of these capabilities are available at local crime laboratories, state-of-the-art equipment and breakthroughs in analytical techniques are continually being developed at DOE laboratories. Extensive experience with the handling of radioactive samples at the DOE labs minimizes the chances of cross-contamination of evidence received from law enforcement. In addition to high-sensitivity analyses, many of the field techniques developed for use in a nuclear facility can assist law enforcement personnel in detecting illicit materials and operations, in retrieving of pertinent evidence and in surveying crime scenes. Some of these tools include chemical sniffers, hand-held detectors, thermal imaging, etc. In addition, mobile laboratories can be deployed to a crime scene to provide field screening of potential evidence. A variety of portable sensors can be deployed on vehicle, aerial, surface or submersible platforms to assist in the location of pertinent evidence or illicit operations. Several specific nuclear technologies available to law enforcement and their potential uses are discussed.},

abstract = {The dynamics of extinction and diversification determine the long-term effects of extinction episodes. If rapid bursts of extinction are offset by equally rapid bursts of diversification, their biodiversity consequences will be transient. But if diversification rates cannot accelerate rapidly enough, pulses of extinction will lead to long-lasting depletion of biodiversity. Here I use spectral analysis of the fossil record to test whether diversification rates can accelerate as much as extinction rates, over both short and long spans of geological time. I show that although the long-wavelength variability of diversification rates equals or exceeds that of extinctions, diversification rates are markedly less variable than extinction rates at wavelengths shorter than roughly 25 million years. This implies that there are intrinsic speed limits that constrain how rapidly diversification rates can accelerate in response to pulses of extinction.},

abstract = {Remediation efforts are typically assessed through before-and-after comparisons of contaminant concentrations or loads. These comparisons can be misleading when external drivers, such as weather conditions, differ between the pre- and postremediation monitoring periods. Here, we show that remediation effectiveness may be better assessed by comparing pre- and postremediation contaminant rating curves, which permit "all else equal" comparisons of pre- and postremediation contaminant concentrations and loads under at any specified external forcing. We illustrate this approach with a remediation case study at an abandoned mercury mine in Northern California. Measured mercury loads in the stream draining the mine site were a factor of 1000 smaller after the remediation than before, superficially suggesting that the cleanup was 99.9\% effective, but rainstorms were weaker and less frequent during the postremediation monitoring period. Our analysis shows that this difference in weather conditions alone reduced mercury loads at our site by a factor of 73-85, with a further factor of 12.6-14.5 being attributable to the remediation itself, implying that the cleanup was 92-93\% (rather than 99.9\%) effective. Our results illustrate the need to account for external confounding drivers when assessing remediation efforts, particularly in systems with highly episodic forcing.},

abstract = {Eighteen months of 7-hourly analyses of rainfall and stream water chemistry are presented, spanning a wide range of chemical determinands and building on over 20 years of weekly records for the moorland headwaters of the river Severn. The high-frequency time series data show that hydrochemical responses to major hydrological and biological drivers of short-term variability in rainfall and rivers are not captured by conventional low-frequency monitoring programmes. A wealth of flow related, flow independent, diurnal, seasonal and annual fluctuations indicate a cacophony of interactions within the catchment and stream. The complexity of the chemical dynamics is visually obvious, although there appears to be no clear way of translating this complexity into a simple algorithm. The work provides a proof of concept for the complex structure of catchment functioning revealed by extensive high-frequency measurements coupled with high analytical sensitivity and reproducibility. It provides new insights into hydrogeochemical functioning and a novel resource for catchment modelling.},

Here, we report on results from a large-scale survey of the submission process, covering 923 scientific journals from the biological sciences in years 2006 to 2008. Manuscript flows among journals revealed a modular submission network, with high-impact journals preferentially attracting submissions. However, about 75\% of published articles were submitted first to the journal that would publish them, and high-impact journals published proportionally more articles that had been resubmitted from another journal. Submission history affected post-publication impact: Resubmissions from other journals received significantly more citations than first-intent submissions, and resubmissions between different journal communities received significantly fewer citations.},

@article{Neal2010,
abstract = {This paper presents new information on the hydrology and water quality of the eroding peatland headwaters of the River Severn in mid-Wales and links it to the impact of plantation conifer forestry further down the catchment. The Upper Hafren is dominated by low-growing peatland vegetation, with an average annual precipitation of around 2650 mm with around 250 mm evaporation. With low catchment permeability, stream response to rainfall is "flashy" with the rising limb to peak stormflow typically under an hour. The water quality is characteristically "dilute"; stormflow is acidic and enriched in aluminium and iron from the acid organic soil inputs. Baseflow is circum-neutral and calcium and bicarbonate bearing due to the inputs of groundwater enriched from weathering of the underlying rocks. Annual cycling is observed for the nutrients reflecting uptake and decomposition processes linked to the vegetation and for arsenic implying seasonal water-logging within the peat soils and underlying glacial drift. Over the decadal scale, sulphate and nitrate concentrations have declined while Gran alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon and iron have increased, indicating a reduction in stream acidification. Within the forested areas the water quality is slightly more concentrated and acidic, transgressing the boundary for acid neutralisation capacity as a threshold for biological damage. Annual sulphate and aluminium concentrations are double those observed in the Upper Hafren, reflecting the influence of forestry and the greater ability of trees to scavenge pollutant inputs from gaseous and mist/cloud-water sources compared to short vegetation. Acidification is decreasing more rapidly in the forest compared to the eroding peatland possibly due to the progressive harvesting of the mature forest reducing the scavenging of acidifying inputs. For the Lower Hafren, long-term average annual precipitation is slightly lower, with lower average altitude, at around 2520mm and evaporation is around double that of the Upper Hafren.},

abstract = {We are developing a dual panel breast-dedicated PET system using LSO scintillators coupled to position sensitive avalanche photodiodes (PSAPD). The charge output is amplified and read using NOVA RENA-3 ASICs. This paper shows that the coincidence timing resolution of the RENA-3 ASIC can be improved using certain list-mode calibrations. We treat the calibration problem as a convex optimization problem and use the RENA-3s analog-based timing system to correct the measured data for time dispersion effects from correlated noise, PSAPD signal delays and varying signal amplitudes. The direct solution to the optimization problem involves a matrix inversion that grows order (n3) with the number of parameters. An iterative method using single-coordinate descent to approximate the inversion grows order (n). The inversion does not need to run to convergence, since any gains at high iteration number will be low compared to noise amplification. The system calibration method is demonstrated with measured pulser data as well as with two LSO-PSAPD detectors in electronic coincidence. After applying the algorithm, the 511keV photopeak paired coincidence time resolution from the LSO-PSAPD detectors under study improved by 57\%, from the raw value of 16.30.07 ns FWHM to 6.920.02 ns FWHM (11.520.05 ns to 4.890.02 ns for unpaired photons).},

abstract = {Zero-valent iron nanoparticles (INP) were synthesized and stabilized using poly acrylic acid (PAA) to yield stabilized INP (S-INP). A two-dimensional physical model was used to study the fate and transport of the INP and S-INP in porous media under saturated, steady-state flow conditions. Transport data for a nonreactive tracer, INP, and S-INP were collected under similar flow conditions. The results show that unstabilized INP cannot be transported into groundwater systems. On the other hand, the S-INP can be transported like a tracer without significant retardation. However, the S-INP plume migrated downward as it moved horizontally in the physical model, indicating that small density gradients have significant influence on two-dimensional transport. The variable-density groundwater flow model SEAWAT was used to model the observed density-driven transport patterns. This is the first time a two-dimensional transport data set is reported for demonstrating the multidimensional transport characteristics of nanoparticles. The data shows the importance of density effects, which cannot be fully discerned using one-dimensional, column experiments. Finally, we also demonstrate that the numerical model SEAWAT can be used to predict the density-driven transport characteristics of S-INP in groundwater aquifers.},

abstract = {Groundwater pollution sources are characterized by spatially and temporally varying source locations, injection rates, and duration of activity. Concentration measurement data at specified observation locations are generally utilized to identify these sources characteristics. Identification of unknown groundwater pollution sources in terms of these source characteristics becomes more difficult in the absence of complete breakthrough curves of concentration history at all the time steps. If concentration observations are missing over a length of time after an unknown source has become active, it is even more difficult to correctly identify the unknown sources. An artificial neural network (ANN) based methodology is developed to identify these source characteristics for such a missing data scenario, when concentration measurement data over an initial length of time is not available. The source characteristics and the corresponding concentration measurements at time steps for which it is not missing, constitute a pattern for training the ANN. A groundwater flow and transport numerical simulation model is utilized to generate the necessary patterns for training the ANN. Performance evaluation results show that the back-propagation based ANN model is essentially capable of extracting hidden relationship between patterns of available concentration measurement values, and the corresponding sources characteristics, resulting in identification of unknown groundwater pollution sources. The performance of the methodology is also evaluated for different levels of noise (or measurement errors) in concentration measurement data at available time steps.},

abstract = {Assembly of plant Shaker subunits as heterotetramers, increasing channel functional diversity, has been reported. Here we focus on a new interaction, between AKT2 and KAT2 subunits. The assembly as AKT2/KAT2 heterotetramers is demonstrated by (i) a strong signal in two-hybrid tests with intracytoplasmic C-terminal regions, (ii) the effect of KAT2 on AKT2 subunit targeting in tobacco cells, (iii) the complete inhibition of AKT2 currents by co-expression with a dominant-negative KAT2 subunit in Xenopus oocytes, and reciprocally, and (iv) the appearance, upon co-expression of wild-type AKT2 and KAT2 subunits, of new channel functional properties that cannot be explained by the co-existence of two kinds of homotetrameric channels. In particular, the instantaneous current, characteristic of AKT2, displayed new functional features when compared with those of AKT2 homotetramers: activation by external acidification (instead of inhibition) and weak inhibition by calcium. Single channel current measurements in oocytes co-expressing AKT2 and KAT2 revealed a strong preference for incorporation of subunits into heteromultimers and a diversity of individual channels. In planta, these new channels, which may undergo specific regulations, are likely to be formed in guard cells and in the phloem, where they could participate in the control of membrane potential and potassium fluxes.},

abstract = {The federal Early Head Start (EHS) program began in 1995, and a randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 17 EHS programs. In all, 3,001 low-income families (35\% African American, 24\% Hispanic, and 37\% White) with a pregnant women or an infant under the age of 12 months were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group (with 91\% of the treatment group receiving some services). Data were collected when the children were about 1, 2, and 3 years of age, and at age 5 (2 years after leaving EHS). Research questions examined (1) impacts of EHS at ages 2 and 3 (when services were being offered) and at age 5, and (2) contributions of early education experiences across children's first 5 years of life. Child outcomes included cognition, language, attention, behavior problems, and health; maternal outcomes included parenting, mental health, and employment. Overall impact analyses at ages 2 and 3 indicated that EHS benefited children and families: impacts were seen in all domains, with effect sizes of significant impacts ranging from .10 to .20. At age 5, EHS children had better attention and approaches toward learning as well as fewer behavior problems than the control group, although they did not differ on early school achievement. Subgroup analyses indicated that cognitive impacts were sustained 2 years after the program ended for African American children and language impacts for Hispanic children who spoke Spanish. Some significant family benefits were seen at age 5. Mediated analyses identified which child and family impacts at ages 2 and 3 contributed to the child impacts at age 5 (most relevant were earlier treatment effects on child cognition and on engagement with the parent). Growth curve analyses were also conducted. Although fewer than half the children enrolled in center-based preschool programs between ages 3 and 4, almost 90\% participated in the year preceding kindergarten. A higher percentage of EHS than control children were enrolled. Nonexperimental analyses suggested that formal program participation enhanced children's readiness for school while also increasing parent-reported aggression. At age 5, those children and families who experienced EHS followed by formal programs fared best overall. However, the benefits of the two experiences were associated with outcomes in different ways. Benefits in language, behavior, and parenting were associated primarily with EHS; benefits in early school achievement were associated primarily with preschool attendance.},

abstract = {Although temperature-induced changes in membrane structure and activity seem to be central to chilling stress perception, the specific details of temperature effects on plant nutrient acquisition remain obscure. In this study, we have undertaken a comparative study of low temperature effects on the activity of plasma membrane transporters of different ions in corn (Zea mays L.) leaf and root tissues by non-invasive measurements of net ion fluxes using ion-selective microelectrode (the MIFE) technique. Kinetics of net H+, Ca2+, K+, Na+, NH+4 and Cl- fluxes were measured as plant tissues recovered after short-term (3 h) chilling stress. The major findings can be summarized as follows: (1) The critical temperatures, under which the recovery of the activity of plasma membrane transporters took place, were found to be the same for all ions measured and are likely to be associated with the phase transition of membrane lipids. (2) The most pronounced was the reduction in net uptake of K+ and NH+4 (3) Chilling treatment caused a significant net influx of Cl- and Na+ in the leaf tissue. (4) For the same species, the critical temperatures for membrane-transport processes in roots were 2-2.5 degrees C lower than in leaves. Possible physiological significance of these findings is discussed.},

abstract = {A framework is provided for scaling and scale issues in hydrology. The first section gives some basic definitions. This is important as researchers do not seem to have agreed on the meaning of concepts such as scale or upscaling. ‘Process scale’, ‘observation scale’ and ‘modelling (working) scale’ require different definitions. The second section discusses heterogeneity and variability in catchments and touches on the implications of randomness and organization for scaling. The third section addresses the linkages across scales from a modelling point of view. It is argued that up- scaling typically consists of two steps: distributing and aggregating. Conversely, downscaling involves disaggregation and singling out. Different approaches are discussed for linking state variables, parameters, inputs and conceptual- izations across scales. This section also deals with distributed parameter models, which are one way of linking con- ceptualizations across scales. The fourth section addresses the linkages across scales from a more holistic perspective dealing with dimensional analysis and similarity concepts. The main difference to the modelling point of view is that dimensional analysis and similarity concepts deal with complex processes in a much simpler fashion. Examples of dimensional analysis, similarity analysis and functional normalization in catchment hydrology are given. This section also briefly discusses fractals, which are a popular tool for quantifying variability across scales. The fifth section focuses on one particular aspect of this holistic view, discussing stream network analysis. The paper concludes with identifying key issues and gives some directions for future research.},

abstract = {The federal Early Head Start (EHS) program began in 1995, and a randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 17 EHS programs. In all, 3,001 low-income families (35\% African American, 24\% Hispanic, and 37\% White) with a pregnant women or an infant under the age of 12 months were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group (with 91\% of the treatment group receiving some services). Data were collected when the children were about 1, 2, and 3 years of age, and at age 5 (2 years after leaving EHS). Research questions examined (1) impacts of EHS at ages 2 and 3 (when services were being offered) and at age 5, and (2) contributions of early education experiences across children's first 5 years of life. Child outcomes included cognition, language, attention, behavior problems, and health; maternal outcomes included parenting, mental health, and employment. Overall impact analyses at ages 2 and 3 indicated that EHS benefited children and families: impacts were seen in all domains, with effect sizes of significant impacts ranging from .10 to .20. At age 5, EHS children had better attention and approaches toward learning as well as fewer behavior problems than the control group, although they did not differ on early school achievement. Subgroup analyses indicated that cognitive impacts were sustained 2 years after the program ended for African American children and language impacts for Hispanic children who spoke Spanish. Some significant family benefits were seen at age 5. Mediated analyses identified which child and family impacts at ages 2 and 3 contributed to the child impacts at age 5 (most relevant were earlier treatment effects on child cognition and on engagement with the parent). Growth curve analyses were also conducted. Although fewer than half the children enrolled in center-based preschool programs between ages 3 and 4, almost 90\% participated in the year preceding kindergarten. A higher percentage of EHS than control children were enrolled. Nonexperimental analyses suggested that formal program participation enhanced children's readiness for school while also increasing parent-reported aggression. At age 5, those children and families who experienced EHS followed by formal programs fared best overall. However, the benefits of the two experiences were associated with outcomes in different ways. Benefits in language, behavior, and parenting were associated primarily with EHS; benefits in early school achievement were associated primarily with preschool attendance.},

abstract = {Household hazardous waste (HHW) is a term used to describe hazardous wastes entering the municipal waste stream. It represents a variety of waste types classified together based on the possession of hazardous properties. This chapter takes a look at the problems related to the disposal of chemicals and other hazardous substances used in the home. HHW is a small proportion of the municipal waste stream, but the potential risks to the environment and health are disproportionate to its size. Although estimates of the amount of HHW vary from region to region and across national boundaries, it generally comprises 1–4\% of municipal solid waste (MSW). Internationally, most HHW is co-disposed with MSW to municipal waste landfills. Co-disposal of potentially hazardous wastes can lead to an increase in hazard status; not only are these substances potentially dangerous to the environment and health, but they can also induce changes in other waste streams by reacting directly with the waste or by altering the redox environment. Landfill simulations, based on current MSW disposal patterns, reveal the risk to the environment from leakage of potentially hazardous materials from landfills to be small but existent. There is a growing tendency for waste disposal authorities to make provision for the separate collection of many items of HHW. The increased cost of separate HHW collection and disposal must be considered alongside the new environmental and health risks posed by changes to disposal practice and the general trend of reduced hazardous content of most consumer goods.},

abstract = {We consider advective-reactive solute transport in porous media whose hydraulic and transport properties are uncertain. These properties are treated as random fields, which renders nonlinear advection-reaction transport equations stochastic. We derive a deterministic equation for the probability density function (PDF) of the concentration of a solute that undergoes heterogeneous reactions, e.g., precipitation or dissolution. The derivation treats exactly (without linearization) a reactive term in the transport equation which accounts for uncertainty (randomness) in both flow velocity and kinetic rate constants but requires a closure, such as a Large-Eddy-Diffusivity (LED) approximation used in the present analysis. No closure is required when reaction rates are the only source of uncertainty. We use exact concentration PDFs obtained for this setting to analyze the accuracy of our general, LED-based PDF equations.},

abstract = {The global glass production in 2007 was approximately 135 million tonnes, of which container and flat glass glass accounted for 72 and 44 million tonnes respectively. The main environmental impacts from producing glass products are the high energy use in batch melting and resulting gaseous emissions. Whilst glass container re-use and closed loop recycling have their own environmental burdens, they can nevertheless significantly reduce energy use and resultant emissions. A comparison of global consumption and recycling volumes demonstrates a potential reduction of 54 × 106 GJ in energy use and 8.3 × 106 t a-1 CO2 emissions based on an 80\% overall global recycling rate, compared with the rate achieved in 2007. The core challenge in realising this potential is the maintenance and enhancement of recycling infrastructures to produce high quality manufacturing ready cullet, combined with a balanced demand from closed loop production facilities.
This chapter explores the environmental issues arising from glass production and consumption. Glass is in the background of the daily lives of most people. The potential for glass recycling comes largely from the container and flat glass sectors, because of their dominance in terms of mass, and their relatively uniform chemical composition, with soda lime–silica glass accounting for virtually all the container and flat glass produced. The main environmental impacts in glass making are the high-energy use in batch melting, and the resultant gaseous emissions from fuel combustion and the heat reaction of components of the batch mix. The core challenge for environmentally and cost-effective recycling of container glass arises from the dispersed nature of its sources, principally households, and the consequent need for an environmentally and cost-effective infrastructure providing for its color separation, collection, and transportation to processors to produce furnace ready feedstock. In assessing the scope for increasing the amount of glass recycled, there is an overall need to quantify the resultant energy and other environmental burdens to allow valid comparisons to be made with the burdens of using virgin feedstock.},

abstract = {The hazardous attributes of the waste are usually based on its inherent physicochemical properties, including its likelihood to ignite, explode, and react with water. The hazardous inherent properties of a waste can also be biological, such as the infectious nature of medical wastes, or a chemical compound that has been shown to elicit acute effects, for example skin irritations and chronic effects, such as cancer; harm to the endocrine, immune, or nervous system; interference with tissue development and reproduction; or mutations, birth defects, or other toxic endpoints. Hazardous waste management involves reducing the amount of hazardous substances produced, treating hazardous wastes to reduce their toxicity, and applying sound engineering controls to reduce or eliminate exposures to these wastes. Waste-treatment technologies include physical treatment, chemical treatment, biological treatment, incineration, and solidification or stabilization treatment. The selection of the most effective technology depends on the characteristics of the wastes being treated. Similarly, the characteristics of the media in need of treatment determine the performance of any contaminant treatment or control. These processes recycle and reuse waste materials, reduce the volume and toxicity of a waste stream, or produce a final residual material that is suitable for disposal.},

One popular and effective approach for addressing such difficulties is to capture successful solutions in design patterns, abstract descriptions of interacting software components that can be customized to solve design problems within a particular context. Based upon a review of existing frameworks and our own experiences building visualization software, we present a series of design patterns for the domain of information visualization. We discuss the structure, context of use, and interrelations of patterns spanning data representation, graphics, and interaction. By representing design knowledge in a reusable form, these patterns can be used to facilitate software design, implementation, and evaluation, and improve developer education and communication.},

abstract = {Locally weighted regression, or loess, is a way of estimating a regression surface through a multivariate smoothing procedure, fitting a function of the independent variables locally and in a moving fashion analogous to how a moving average is computed for a time series. With local fitting we can estimate a much wider class of regression surfaces than with the usual classes of parametric functions, such as polynomials. The goal of this article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced: (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of univariate locally weighted regression; (b) statistical procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares fitting of parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods that are useful tools for understanding loess estimates and checking the assumption...},

@article{Zhang2007,
abstract = {In case contaminants are found in enclosed environments such as aircraft cabins or buildings, it is useful to find the contaminant sources. One method to locate contaminant sources is by inverse computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. As the inverse CFD modeling is ill posed, this paper has proposed to solve a quasi-reversibility (QR) equation for contaminant transport. The equation improves the numerical stability by replacing the second-order diffusion term with a fourth-order stabilization term in the governing equation of contaminant transport. In addition, a numerical scheme for solving the QR equation in unstructured meshes has been developed. This paper demonstrates how to use the inverse CFD model with the QR equation and numerical scheme to identify gaseous contaminant sources in a two-dimensional aircraft cabin and in a three-dimensional office. The inverse CFD model could identify the contaminant source locations but not very accurate contaminant source strength because of the dispersive property of the QR equation. The results also show that this method works better for convection dominant flows than the flows that convection is not so important. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This paper presents a methodology that can be used to find contaminant source locations and strengths in enclosed environments with the data of airflow and contaminants measured by sensors. The method can be a very useful tool to find where, what, and how contamination has happened. The results can be used to develop appropriate measures to protect occupants in the enclosed environments from infectious diseases or terrorist releases of chemical/biological warfare agents as well as to decontaminate the environments.},

@article{Centofanti2005,
abstract = {The radiological impact of radionuclides released to the terrestrial environment is usually predicted with mathematical models in which the transfer of radionuclides from soil to the plant is described with the transfer factor (TF). This paper questions the validity of the protocols proposed by the International Atomic Energy Agency to measure TF in the field and in greenhouses conditions. We grew maize (Zea mays L.) both in the field after a surface application of radionuclides ((54)Mn, (57)Co, (65)Zn, and (134)Cs) and in a greenhouse with the same soil that has received the same fertilization and that had been previously sieved and homogeneously labeled with the same radionuclides before being repacked in pots. The analysis of the displacement of radionuclides in the field soil profile showed a higher concentration of the surface-applied radionuclides in the preferential flow path (PFP) in comparison to the soil matrix indicating that they infiltrated heterogeneously in the soil profile due to the structure-induced non-uniform water flow. A significantly higher recovery of (57)Co and (134)Cs was observed in the plants grown in the field soil, whereas no differences in the recovery of (54)Mn and (65)Zn between the two experiments were detected. These results suggest that (i) under field conditions the soil-to-plant transfer of radionuclides that co-exist as stable elements present at low concentrations in the soil and in the plant is higher than that measured under greenhouse conditions and (ii) the implicit assumption made when calculating the TF (that radionuclides are homogeneously distributed in the soil profile) is not valid, thereby preventing the calculation of an average concentration to obtain the TF parameter.},

abstract = {A comprehensive Composite Analysis (CA) has been performed considering 152 sources of residual radioactive material at the Savannah River Site (SRS). As part of the CA a model was developed to perform deterministic base case calculations using the commercial GoldSim software. The model treated transport and decay of radionuclides as they are released at the source location and transported through the source region, vadose zone and aquifer to stream outcrops and from there to the Savannah River. A dose to the public was calculated assuming recreational use of stream water and residential use of river water. The specific results from the GoldSim modeling evaluation conducted as part of the CA indicate that the collective maximum dose resulting from the release of radionuclides from all 152 anticipated SRS End State sources of residual radionuclides demonstrate that maximum exposures expected to occur to any offsite MOP will not approach the 300 uSv/yr (30 mrem/yr) dose constraint, and in fact are currently estimated to be only 10\% of this. For each of the POA’s evaluated, the highest cumulative dose is realized at the Lower Three Runs POA and is calculated to be 29.7 uSv/yr (2.97 mrem/yr). The major dose contributing radionuclide for all of the POA’s, with the exception of Upper Three Runs, was 137Cs in the contaminated streambed sediments. In Upper Three Runs 237Np from the H-Area Canyon Building was the major dose contributing radionuclide. The major exposure pathway for the SRS streams (where the Recreational Scenario was evaluated) was by the ingestion of fish. In the Savannah River, where the Residential Scenario was evaluated, ingestion of vegetation was the dominant exposure pathway. The uncertainty evaluation lends added assurance to the conclusion that the 30 mrem/yr dose constraint will not be exceeded, in that even at the 95’th Percentile, this performance measure is not expected to be exceeded. It must also be added that these conclusions should be regarded as “preliminary” since the DOE review process of the SRS CA has not yet been completed.},

abstract = {The present study demonstrates a methodology for optimization of environmental data acquisition. Based on the premise that the worth of data increases in proportion to its ability to reduce the uncertainty of key model predictions, the methodology can be used to compare the worth of different data types, gathered at different locations within study areas of arbitrary complexity. The method is applied to a hypothetical nonlinear, variable density numerical model of salt and heat transport. The relative utilities of temperature and concentration measurements at different locations within the model domain are assessed in terms of their ability to reduce the uncertainty associated with predictions of movement of the salt water interface in response to a decrease in fresh water recharge. In order to test the sensitivity of the method to nonlinear model behavior, analyses were repeated for multiple realizations of system properties. Rankings of observation worth were similar for all realizations, indicating robust performance of the methodology when employed in conjunction with a highly nonlinear model. The analysis showed that while concentration and temperature measurements can both aid in the prediction of interface movement, concentration measurements, especially when taken in proximity to the interface at locations where the interface is expected to move, are of greater worth than temperature measurements. Nevertheless, it was also demonstrated that pairs of temperature measurements, taken in strategic locations with respect to the interface, can also lead to more precise predictions of interface movement.},

Data truncation is a practical necessity of laboratory column experiments because of both time and detection-limit constraints. In this paper, we study the extent to which data truncation can affect estimates of transport modeling parameters, as derived from temporal moment calculations and in the context of solute transport experiments that are influenced by sorption and nonequilibrium partitioning among mobile and immobile phases. Our results show that, for a given amount of solute used, step changes in input conditions can give more accurate moment-derived parameters than Dirac or square-wave pulses, whereas Dirac and square-wave pulses are essentially identical in terms of accuracy of parameter estimates. By simulating data truncation for a wide range of column input and transport conditions, we provide guidance toward the experimental designs that are needed to keep parameter estimation error within specified bounds, assuming nonequilibrium conditions of transport that result from either first-order or diffusion-based rate processes. More specifically, we investigate the relationships between mass of solute added to the system, minimum solute quantification limits, experiment duration times, and accuracy of parameter estimation, all as a function of experimental conditions.},

abstract = {A substantial reservoir (up to 1 kg ha(-1)) of natural perchlorate is present in diverse unsaturated zones of the arid and semi-arid southwestern United States. The perchlorate co-occurs with meteoric chloride that has accumulated in these soils throughout the Holocene [0 to 10-15 ka (thousand years ago)] and possibly longer periods. Previously, natural perchlorate widely believed to be limited to the Atacama Desert, now appears widespread in steppe-to-desert ecoregions. The perchlorate reservoir becomes sufficiently large to affect groundwater when recharge from irrigation or climate change flushes accumulated salts from the unsaturated zone. This new source may help explain increasing reports of perchlorate in dry region agricultural products and should be considered when evaluating overall source contributions.},

abstract = {We consider transport of a solute that undergoes a nonlinear heterogeneous reaction: after reaching a threshold concentration value, it precipitates on the solid matrix to form a crystalline solid. The relative importance of three key pore-scale transport mechanisms (advection, molecular diffusion, and reaction) is quantified by the P\'{e}clet (Pe) and Damk\"{o}hler (Da) numbers. We use multiple-scale expansions to upscale a pore-scale advection-diffusion equation with reactions entering through a boundary condition on the fluid-solid interface, and to establish sufficient conditions under which macroscopic advection-dispersion-reaction equations provide an accurate description of the pore-scale processes. These conditions are summarized by a phase diagram in the (Pe, Da)-space, parameterized with a scale-separation parameter that is defined as the ratio of characteristic lengths associated with the pore- and macro-scales.},

abstract = {This paper is an introduction to model selection intended for nonspecialists who have knowledge of the statistical concepts covered in a typical first (occasionally second) statistics course. The intention is to explain the ideas that generate frequentist methodology for model selection, for example the Akaike information criterion, bootstrap criteria, and cross-validation criteria. Bayesian methods, including the Bayesian information criterion, are also mentioned in the context of the framework outlined in the paper. The ideas are illustrated using an example in which observations are available for the entire population of interest. This enables us to examine and to measure effects that are usually invisible, because in practical applications only a sample from the population is observed. The problem of selection bias, a hazard of which one needs to be aware in the context of model selection, is also discussed. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {This study examines the applicability of the iron-based degradative solidification/stabilization (DS/S-Fe(II)) process to 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA), which is one of common chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) of concern at contaminated sites. DS/S-Fe(II) combines contaminant degradation by Fe(II) and immobilization by the hydration reactions of Portland cement. The transformation of 1,1,1-TCA by Fe(II) in 10\% Portland cement slurries was studied using a batch slurry reactor system. The effects of Fe(II) dose, pH, and initial concentration of 1,1,1-TCA on the kinetics of 1,1,1-TCA degradation were evaluated. Degradation of 1,1,1-TCA in cement slurries including Fe(II) was very rapid and could be described by a pseudo-first-order rate law. The half-lives for 1,1,1-TCA were measured between 0.4 and 5h when Fe(II) dose ranged from 4.9 to 39.2mM. The pseudo-first-order rate constant increased with pH to a maximum near pH 12.5. A saturation rate equation was able to predict degradation kinetics over a wide range of target organic concentrations and at higher Fe(II) doses. The major transformation product of 1,1,1-TCA in mixtures of Fe(II) and cement was 1,1-dichloroethane (1,1-DCA), which indicates that degradation occurred by a hydrogenolysis pathway. A small amount of ethane was observed. The conversion of 1,1,1-TCA to ethane was better described by a parallel reaction model than by a consecutive reaction model.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a quaternion-based Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for estimating the three-dimensional orientation of a rigid body. The EKF exploits the measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that is integrated with a tri-axial magnetic sensor. Magnetic disturbances and gyro bias errors are modeled and compensated by including them in the filter state vector. We employ the observability rank criterion based on Lie derivatives to verify the conditions under which the nonlinear system that describes the process of motion tracking by the IMU is observable, namely it may provide sufficient information for performing the estimation task with bounded estimation errors. The observability conditions are that the magnetic field, perturbed by first-order Gauss-Markov magnetic variations, and the gravity vector are not collinear and that the IMU is subject to some angular motions. Computer simulations and experimental testing are presented to evaluate the algorithm performance, including when the observability conditions are critical.},

abstract = {Abstract The Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc., established the Hydrologic Measurement Facility to transform watershed-scale hydrologic research by facilitating access to advanced instrumentation and expertise that would not otherwise be available to individual investigators. We outline a committee-based process that determined which suites of instrumentation best fit the needs of the hydrological science community and a proposed mechanism for the governance and distribution of these sensors. Here, we also focus on how these proposed suites of instrumentation can be used to address key scientific challenges, including scaling water cycle science in time and space, broadening the scope of individual subdisciplines of water cycle science, and developing mechanistic linkages among these subdisciplines and spatio-temporal scales.},

abstract = {A vertically-integrated analytical model for dissolved phase transport is described that considers a time-dependent DNAPL source based on the upscaled dissolution kinetics model of Parker and Park with extensions to consider time-dependent source zone biodecay, partial source mass reduction, and remediation-enhanced source dissolution kinetics. The model also considers spatial variability in aqueous plume decay, which is treated as the sum of aqueous biodecay and volatilization due to diffusive transport and barometric pumping through the unsaturated zone. The model is implemented in Excel/VBA coupled with (1) an inverse solution that utilizes prior information on model parameters and their uncertainty to condition the solution, and (2) an error analysis module that computes parameter covariances and total prediction uncertainty due to regression error and parameter uncertainty. A hypothetical case study is presented to evaluate the feasibility of calibrating the model from limited noisy field data. The results indicate that prediction uncertainty increases significantly over time following calibration, primarily due to propagation of parameter uncertainty. However, differences between the predicted performance of source zone partial mass reduction and the known true performance were reasonably small. Furthermore, a clear difference is observed between the predicted performance for the remedial action scenario versus that for a no-action scenario, which is consistent with the true system behavior. The results suggest that the model formulation can be effectively utilized to assess monitored natural attenuation and source remediation options if careful attention is given to model calibration and prediction uncertainty issues.},

@book{Seeger2004,
abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are natural generalisations of multivariate Gaussian random variables to infinite (countably or continuous) index sets. GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community. Our focus is on a simple presentation, but references to more detailed sources are provided.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the chronic effects on the central nervous system of exposure to low concentrations of toluene (TWA < 20 ppm) on workers in a rotogravure plant. Ninety-eight male workers from a selection pool of 107 (92\%) were examined neuropsychologically using a Cognitive Function Scanner, and neurologically by computerized methods measuring co-ordination ability, tremor and position stability. In addition measures of symptoms and former exposure were obtained by questionnaire. The workers were divided into three groups: Group 0 with no exposure to organic solvents (n = 19); Group 1 with exposure to TWA < 20 ppm of toluene for less than 13 years (n = 30) and Group 2 with exposure for more than 12 years (n = 49). Within Group 2, 37 (75\%) had been exposed at levels exceeding 100 ppm for 10+ years before 1983. No significant differences were found between Group 0 and Group 1 regarding symptoms and results of the applied tests. Group 2 differed significantly from the two other groups in scoring higher on a symptom index (p = 0.04), particularly regarding concentration ability, reduced memory and fatigue. Group 2 scored significantly poorer on tests for visuospatial function, number learning and word recognition, while no differences regarding neurological functions were observed. The study showed no differences regarding neuropsychological and neurological functions between a non-exposed group of male workers and workers exposed to toluene less than 13 years at TWA < 20 ppm. However, long-term exposure to TWA (time weighted average) of toluene exceeding 100 ppm was associated with impaired neuropsychological function.},

abstract = {This study investigated the benefits of partial removal of dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source zones using enhanced dissolution in eight laboratory scale experiments. The benefits were assessed by characterizing the relationship between reductions in DNAPL mass and the corresponding reduction in contaminant mass flux. Four flushing agents were evaluated in eight controlled laboratory experiments to examine the effects of displacement fluid property contrasts and associated override and underride on contaminant flux reduction (R(j)) vs. mass reduction (R(m)) relationships (R(j)(R(m))): 1) 50\% ethanol/50\% water (less dense than water), 2) 40\% ethyl-lactate/60\% water (more dense than water), 3) 18\% ethanol/26\% ethyl-lactate/56\% water (neutrally buoyant), and 4) 2\% Tween-80 surfactant (also neutrally buoyant). For each DNAPL architecture evaluated, replicate experiments were conducted where source zone dissolution was conducted with a single flushing event to remove most of the DNAPL from the system, and with multiple shorter-duration floods to determine the path of the R(j)(R(m)) relationship. All of the single-flushing experiments exhibited similar R(j)(R(m)) relationships indicating that override and underride effects associated with cosolvents did not significantly affect the remediation performance of the agents. The R(j)(R(m)) relationship of the multiple injection experiments for the cosolvents with a density contrast with water tended to be less desirable in the sense that there was less R(j) for a given R(m). UTCHEM simulations supported the observations from the laboratory experiments and demonstrated the capability of this model to predict R(j)(R(m)) relationships for non-uniformly distributed NAPL sources.},

abstract = {A combination of geochemical, microbiological and isotopic methods were used to evaluate in-situ bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons at one site contaminated with refinery waste and a second site contaminated with aviation gasoline at Alameda Point, California. At each site, geochemical and microbiological characteristics from four locations in the contaminated zone were compared to those from two uncontaminated background locations. At both sites, the geochemical indicators of in-situ biodegradation included depleted soil gas and groundwater oxygen, elevated groundwater alkalinity, and elevated soil gas carbon dioxide and methane in the contaminated zone relative to the background. Radiocarbon content of methane and carbon dioxide measured in soil gas at both sites indicated that they were derived from hydrocarbon contaminant degradation. Direct microscopy of soil core samples using cell wall stains and activity stains, revealed elevated microbial numbers and enhanced microbial activities in contaminated areas relative to background areas, corroborating geochemical findings. While microbial plate counts and microcosm studies using soil core samples provided laboratory evidence for the presence of some microbial activity and contaminant degradation abilities, they did not correlate well with either contaminant location, geochemical, isotopic, or direct microscopy data.},

abstract = {The results of seven years lysimeter experiments to determine the uptake of 60Co, 137Cs and 226Ra into agricultural crops (endive, maize, wheat, mustard, sugarbeet, potato, Faba bean, rye grass) are described. The lysimeter consists of twelve monolithic soil profiles (four soil types and three replicates) and is located in Seibersdorf/Austria, a region with a pannonian climate (pronounced differences between hot and semi-arid summers and humid winter conditions, annual mean of precipitation: 517 mm, mean annual temperature: 9.8 degrees C). Besides soil-to-plant transfer factors (TF), fluxes were calculated taking into account biomass production and growth time. Total median values of TF's (dry matter basis) for the three radionuclides decreased from 226Ra (0.068 kg kg(-1)) to 137Cs (0.043 kg kg(-1)) and 60Co (0.018 kg kg(-1)); flux values exhibited the same ranking. The varying physical and chemical properties of the four experimental soils resulted in statistically significant differences in transfer factors or fluxes between the investigated soils for 137Cs and 226Ra, but not for 60Co. Differences in transfer between plant species and plant parts are distinct, with graminaceous species showing, on average, TF values 5.8 and 15 times lower than dicotyledonous species for 137Cs and 60Co, respectively. This pattern was not found for 226Ra. It can be concluded that 137Cs transfer is heavily influenced by soil characteristics, whilst the plant-specific factors are the main source of TF variability for 60Co. The variability of 226Ra transfer originates both from soil properties and plant species behaviour.},

abstract = {This study investigated the benefits of partial removal of dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source zones using enhanced dissolution in eight laboratory scale experiments. The benefits were assessed by characterizing the relationship between reductions in DNAPL mass and the corresponding reduction in contaminant mass flux. Four flushing agents were evaluated in eight controlled laboratory experiments to examine the effects of displacement fluid property contrasts and associated override and underride on contaminant flux reduction (R(j)) vs. mass reduction (R(m)) relationships (R(j)(R(m))): 1) 50\% ethanol/50\% water (less dense than water), 2) 40\% ethyl-lactate/60\% water (more dense than water), 3) 18\% ethanol/26\% ethyl-lactate/56\% water (neutrally buoyant), and 4) 2\% Tween-80 surfactant (also neutrally buoyant). For each DNAPL architecture evaluated, replicate experiments were conducted where source zone dissolution was conducted with a single flushing event to remove most of the DNAPL from the system, and with multiple shorter-duration floods to determine the path of the R(j)(R(m)) relationship. All of the single-flushing experiments exhibited similar R(j)(R(m)) relationships indicating that override and underride effects associated with cosolvents did not significantly affect the remediation performance of the agents. The R(j)(R(m)) relationship of the multiple injection experiments for the cosolvents with a density contrast with water tended to be less desirable in the sense that there was less R(j) for a given R(m). UTCHEM simulations supported the observations from the laboratory experiments and demonstrated the capability of this model to predict R(j)(R(m)) relationships for non-uniformly distributed NAPL sources.},

abstract = {For over thirty years David S. Landes's The Unbound Prometheus has offered an unrivalled history of industrial revolution and economic development in Europe. Now, in this new edition, the author reframes and reasserts his original arguments in the light of current debates about globalisation and comparative economic growth. The book begins with a classic account of the characteristics, progress, and political, economic and social implications of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, France and Germany. Professor Landes here raises the much-debated question: why was Europe the first to industrialise? He then charts the economic history of the twentieth-century: the effect of the First World War in accelerating the dissolution of the old international economy; the economic crisis of 1929-32; Europe's recovery and unprecedented economic growth following the Second World War. He concludes that only by continuous industrial revolution can Europe and the world sustain itself in the years ahead.},

abstract = {Long-term controlled experiments under natural conditions in the field have been carried out in the Chernobyl Exclusion zone in order to determine the parameters governing radioiodine transfer to plants from four types of soils (podzoluvisol, greyzem and typical and meadow chernozem) homogeneously contaminated in the 20-cm upper layer with an addition of (125)I. An absence of (125)I depletion in arable soil layers due to volatilization was noted up to one year after contamination. During one year, depletion due to the vertical migration of radioiodine from the arable layer of each of the soils did not exceed 4\% of the total (125)I content. Radioiodine concentration ratios (CR) were obtained in radish roots, lettuce leaves, bean pods, and wheat grain and straw. The highest CR values were observed in podzoluvisol: 0.01-0.03 for radish roots and lettuce leaves, 0.003-0.004 for bean pods and 0.001 for wheat grains. In the other three soils, these values were one order of magnitude lower. The parameters relating to changes in radioiodine bioavailability were determined, based on the contamination dynamics of plants in field conditions.},

abstract = {
Heterogeneity in naturally occurring carbonaceous materials (CMs) causes sorbed hydrophobic organic compound (HOC) concentrations in soils, sediments, and rocks to occur as a combination of surface adsorption and phase partitioning, with the latter typically more linearly dependent on aqueous concentration. In this manuscript, we describe a model to simulate HOC sorption as the combined effect of adsorption to thermally altered CM and a more linear solvation-driven absorption into gel-like CM (organic matter). We describe different forms of thermally altered CM (such as soots, chars, coals, and kerogen), the manner in which these materials can serve as especially strong adsorbents, and the conditions under which they can control solid-aqueous distribution. Specific examples of model fits to soil, sediment and rock samples with identified thermally altered CM components provide a linkage between sorption components and sorbent material properties. Because both the adsorption and partition components are scalable by compound solubility, it may often be possible to estimate nonlinear isotherms for a wide range of chemicals based on comparatively few experimental measurements. Thermally altered CM is widespread in the environment and can serve as an important sorbent even when present in small quantities (especially at low concentrations of adsorbates). In this context, the sorption modeling refinements described in this work are expected to have wide applicability. Given that solid/water distribution is a central process affecting contaminant fate, such refined models are an essential element for better estimates of risk and improved remediation design.},

abstract = {
The generalized integral transform technique (GITT) is applied to solve the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation (ADE) in heterogeneous porous media coupled with either linear or nonlinear sorption and decay. When both sorption and decay are linear, analytical solutions are obtained using the GITT for one-dimensional ADEs with spatially and temporally variable flow and dispersion coefficient and arbitrary initial and boundary conditions. When either sorption or decay is nonlinear the solutions to ADEs with the GITT are hybrid analytical-numerical. In both linear and nonlinear cases, the forward and inverse integral transforms for the problems described in the paper are apparent and straightforward. Some illustrative examples with linear sorption and decay are presented to demonstrate the application and check the accuracy of the derived analytical solutions. The derived hybrid analytical-numerical solutions are checked against a numerical approach and demonstratively applied to a nonlinear transport example, which simulates a simplified system of iron oxide bioreduction with nonlinear sorption and nonlinear reaction kinetics.},

abstract = {At the request of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Research Council (NRC) recently completed a major report, Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment, that is intended to strengthen the scientific basis, credibility, and effectiveness of risk assessment practices and subsequent risk management decisions. The report describes the challenges faced by risk assessment and the need to consider improvements in both the technical analyses of risk assessments (i.e., the development and use of scientific information to improve risk characterization) and the utility of risk assessments (i.e., making assessments more relevant and useful for risk management decisions). The report tackles a number of topics relating to improvements in the process, including the design and framing of risk assessments, uncertainty and variability characterization, selection and use of defaults, unification of cancer and noncancer dose-response assessment, cumulative risk assessment, and the need to increase EPA's capacity to address these improvements. This article describes and summarizes the NRC report, with an eye toward its implications for risk assessment practices at EPA.},

abstract = {A valid performance assessment of radioactive waste repositories strongly depends on the reliability of nuclide transport parameters, including distribution and diffusion coefficients. To reduce the waste produced and time spent conducting diffusion experiments, a robust model is required to accurately interpret the experiment results. Therefore, we developed a through-diffusion model with parent-daughter nuclide decay chain. We validated our model through comparisons with the Moridis model (Moridis, 1999) and Bharat model (Bharat et al., 2009), assessing our model and these two models using the distribution of parent nuclide concentrations. This strongly supports the rationality and functionality of extending our proposed model to daughter nuclides. In this study, we derived analytical solutions for the parent nuclides of the through-diffusion experiment using the multicompartment (MC) model. We also propose a simplified formula for estimating the apparent diffusion coefficient of parent nuclides based on the analytical solutions. Through numerical experiments, we verified the feasibility of the formula. Our models are useful for determining the apparent diffusion coefficient of daughter nuclides when conducting through-diffusion experiments with parent-daughter nuclide decay chains. Additionally, the proposed models offer the advantages of saving time and reducing experimental waste.},

abstract = {The problem of estimating log-transmissivity when it is assumed to be a random field can be faced using indirect iterative methods or using the so-called geostatistical approach. A close examination of the two formulations suggests that basic assumptions are similar. In fact, if the iterative method is stopped after one iteration of a Gauss-Newton method, starting from the mean log-T, we show that both estimates and estimation covariance matrices obtained with the two approaches are identical. We then argue that the main difference between the two formulations arises from the way linearization is performed, which is global in non-iterative methods and only local in iterative methods. As a result, the latter are less constrained by linearity than the former and lead to better estimates and to more consistent estimation covariance matrices. This is illustrated with two synthetic examples for several degrees of spatial variability.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The analysis of multiple sequence alignments is allowing researchers to glean valuable insights into evolution, as well as identify genomic regions that may be functional, or discover novel classes of functional elements. Understanding the distribution of conservation levels that constitutes the evolutionary landscape is crucial to distinguishing functional regions from non-functional. Recent evidence suggests that a binary classification of evolutionary rates is inappropriate for this purpose and finds only highly conserved functional elements. Given that the distribution of evolutionary rates is multimodal, determining the number of modes is of paramount concern. Through simulation, we evaluate the performance of a number of information criterion approaches derived from MCMC simulations in determining the dimension of a model. RESULTS: We utilize a Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) approximation that is more robust than the approximations from other information criteria, and show our information criteria approximations do not produce superfluous modes when estimating conservation distributions under a variety of circumstances. We analyse the distribution of conservation for a multiple alignment comprising four primate species and mouse, and repeat this on two additional multiple alignments of similar species. We find evidence of six distinct classes of evolutionary rates that appear to be robust to the species used.

abstract = {A kernel smoother is an intuitive estimate of a regression function or conditional expectation; at each point \$x\_0\$ the estimate of \$E(Y\backslash mid x\_0)\$ is a weighted mean of the sample \$Y\_i\$, with observations close to \$x\_0\$ receiving the largest weights. Unfortunately this simplicity has flaws. At the boundary of the predictor space, the kernel neighborhood is asymmetric and the estimate may have substantial bias. Bias can be a problem in the interior as well if the predictors are nonuniform or if the regression function has substantial curvature. These problems are particularly severe when the predictors are multidimensional. A variety of kernel modifications have been proposed to provide approximate and asymptotic adjustment for these biases. Such methods generally place substantial restrictions on the regression problems that can be considered; in unfavorable situations, they can perform very poorly. Moreover, the necessary modifications are very difficult to implement in the multidimensional case. Local r...},

In this study, a mathematical model is developed to describe contaminant transport in a radial two-zone confined aquifer system. The solution of the model equations can be used to delineate contaminant transport in such a two-zone aquifer system and to investigate the skin effect on the temporal and spatial concentration distribution. The present solution is shown to reduce to an existing solution for transport in a homogeneous aquifer in the case when there is no wellbore skin. The results predicted from the solution indicate that the skin effect has a significant impact on the concentration distribution at early time. But an abrupt change in the spatial concentration distribution may occur at the interface of the skin zone and aquifer formation zone. The results from a sensitivity analysis reveal that dispersivity in the formation zone has a more significant effect on the concentration distribution than do the effects of skin thickness and dispersivity in the skin zone.},

abstract = {This paper gives a review of cross-validation methods. The original applications in multiple linear regression are considered first. It is shown how predictive accuracy depends on sample size and the number of predictor variables. Both two-sample and single-sample cross-validation indices are investigated. The application of cross-validation methods to the analysis of moment structures is then justified. An equivalence of a single-sample cross-validation index and the Akaike information criterion is pointed out. It is seen that the optimal number of parameters suggested by both single-sample and two-sample cross-validation indices will depend on sample size. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Two different experimental techniques employing conservative tracers to determine exfiltration losses in a sewer system are reported. Both techniques compare the in-sewer responses measured along designated indicator and reference sections to assess the level of exfiltration although with different degrees of reliability. The experimental and interpretation errors associated with a pulse dosing technique, in which Rhodamine WT is used as the single tracer, are described. The estimation of exfiltration requires the comparison of indicator and reference peaks which need to be well resolved and reproducible in order to provide realistic results. A more consistent technique involves the continuous dosing of two different tracers with the objective of producing simultaneous downstream peak tracer concentrations. Any errors due to flow variations are eliminated and the longer measurement period allows both peak and background concentrations to be more accurately determined. Rhodamine WT, Li and Br were used in different combinations over the approximately 20 min duration of each continuous dosing experiment and were found to demonstrate conservative behaviours with measured recoveries of 97.6-100.6\%, 97.3-101.4\% and 108.4-109.2\%, respectively. The analytical problems associated with the determination of the different tracers in sewage are described and are shown to be responsible for the reduced accuracy of the results associated with the use of Br. The preferred combination of tracers is Rhodamine WT as the indicator and Li as the reference and these are shown to be capable of estimating sewer losses to an accuracy of +/-1.0\% using the continuous dosing approach.},

abstract = {Contamination of groundwater constrains its uses and poses a serious threat to the environment. Once groundwater is contaminated, the cleanup may be difficult and expensive. Identification of unknown pollution sources is the first step toward adopting any remediation strategy. The proposed methodology exploits the capability of a universal function approximation by a feed-forward multilayer artificial neural network (ANN) to identify the sources in terms of its location, magnitudes, and duration of activity. The back-propagation algorithm is utilized for training the ANN to identify the source characteristics based on simulated concentration data at specified observation locations in the aquifer. Uniform random generation and the Latin hypercube sampling method of random generation are used to generate temporal varying source fluxes. These source fluxes are used in groundwater flow and the transport simulation model to generate necessary data for the ANN model-building processes. Breakthrough curves obtained for the specified pollution scenario are characterized by different methods. The characterized breakthrough curves parameters serve as inputs to ANN model. Unknown pollution source characteristics are outputs for ANN model. Experimentation is also performed with different number of training and testing patterns. In addition, the effects of measurement errors in concentration measurements values are used to show the robustness of ANN based methodology for source identification in case of erroneous data.},

The earlier documents describe the environmental cortsequences of tritium, iodine, and uranium.Documentson plutonium,strontium,carbon, and technetiumwill bepublished inthe future.These aredynamicdocuments andcurrent plans call for revising and updatingeach one on a two-year schedule. Radiocesium exists in the environmentas aresult of above-groundnuclearweapons tests, the Chemobyl accident, the destruction of satellite Cosmos 954, small releases from reactors and reprocessing plants, and the operationof industrial, medical, andeducational facilities. Radiocesium has been produced at SRS during the operation of five production reactors. Several hundred curies of \_TCswas releasedinto streams inthe late 50s and 60s from leaking fuel elements.Smaller quantities were released from the fuel reprocessing operations. About 1400 Ci of 137Cswas released to seepage basins where itwas tightly bound by clay in the soil.A much smaller quantity, about four Ci, was released to the atmosphere. Radiocesium concentration andtransport mechanisms for atmospheric, surface water, and groundwater have been extensively studied by Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) and ecological mechanisms have been studied by Savannah River Ecology Laboratory (SREL). The overall radiological impact of SRS releases on the offsite maximum individual can be characterizedby total doses of 0.33 mrem(atmospheric) and 60 mrem(liquid),compared with a dose of 12,960 mrem from non-SRS soures during the same period of time. Isotope 137Cs releases have resulted in a negligible risk to the environment and the population it supports.},

abstract = {The rational management of water resource systems requires an understanding of their response to existing and planned schemes of exploitation, pollution prevention and/or remediation. Such understanding requires the collection of data to help characterize the system and monitor its response to existing and future stresses. It also requires incorporating such data in models of system makeup, water flow and contaminant transport. As the collection of subsurface characterization and monitoring data is costly, it is imperative that the design of corresponding data collection schemes be cost-effective, i.e., that the expected benefit of new information exceed its cost. A major benefit of new data is its potential to help improve one’s understanding of the system, in large part through a reduction in model predictive uncertainty and corresponding risk of failure. Traditionally, value-of-information or data-worth analyses have relied on a single conceptual-mathematical model of site hydrology with prescribed parameters. Yet there is a growing recognition that ignoring model and parameter uncertainties render model predictions prone to statistical bias and underestimation of uncertainty. This has led to a recent emphasis on conducting hydrologic analyses and rendering corresponding predictions by means of multiple models. We describe a corresponding approach to data-worth analyses within a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) framework. We focus on a maximum likelihood version (MLBMA) of BMA which (a) is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic models, (b) admits but does not require prior information about the parameters, (c) is consistent with modern statistical methods of hydrologic model calibration, (d) allows approximating lead predictive moments of any model by linearization, and (e) updates model posterior probabilities as well as parameter estimates on the basis of potential new data both before and after such data become actually available. We describe both the BMA and MLBMA versions theoretically and implement MLBMA computationally on a synthetic example with and without linearization.},

abstract = {Inverse problems, when only hard data are considered, are mathematically ill-posed because they have multiple solutions and are sensitive to small changes in the data. An example is the determination of hydraulic conductivity from head data. Bayesian methods provide a general stochastic framework within which one can solve such problems. The approach allows one to combine hard data with other information in order to explore the range of possible solutions. We consider the role of generalized (also known as improper) probability distributions within this framework. These distributions are very useful because they represent information parsimoniously (with simple equations and few parameters) and are ideal in terms of representing situations with limited information. They are particularly useful in introducing prior information about the dependent variables of the inverse problem and structural parameters that describe the degree of continuity or smoothness of dependent variables. Additionally, they are very useful from a computational perspective because they can lead to formulations with special structure, such as with high degree of sparsity or structure that can be exploited through high performance computing algorithms. We examine in the context of a simple example some of the consequences of using different generalized priors.},

abstract = {Analytical solutions are developed for approximating the time-dependent contaminant discharge from DNAPL source zones undergoing dissolution and other decay processes. The source functions assume a power relationship between source mass and chemical discharge and can consider partial DNAPL source remediation (depletion) at any time after the initial DNAPL release. The source functions are used as a time-dependent boundary condition in an idealized chemical transport model to develop leading order approximations of the plume response to DNAPL source removal. The results suggest that partial DNAPL remediation does not tend to have a dramatic impact on the maximum extent of the plume if very low concentration values are used to define the plume boundaries. However, the solutions show that partial DNAPL removal from the source zone is likely to lead to large reductions in plume concentrations and mass, and it reduces the longevity of the plume. When the mass discharge from the source zone is linearly related to the DNAPL mass, it is shown that partial DNAPL depletion leads to linearly proportional reductions in the plume mass and concentrations.},

abstract = {When only few monitoring wells are available to assess the extent and level of groundwater contamination, inversion of concentration breakthrough curves acquired during an integral pumping test can be used as an alternative quantification method. The idea is to use concentration-time series recorded during integral pumping tests through an inversion technique to estimate contaminant mass fluxes crossing a control plane. In this paper, we examine how a longitudinal concentration gradient along a contaminant plume length scale affects the estimated inversed-concentration distribution and its associated mass flux. The analytically inversed-concentration distribution at the imaginary control plane (ICP) is compared to a numerically generated concentration distribution, treating the latter one as a "real contaminant plume" characterized by the presence of a longitudinal concentration gradient. It is found that the analytically inversed-concentration can lead to overestimation or underestimation of concentration distribution values depending on the transport time period and dispersivity values. At lower dispersivity values, with shorter transport time periods, the analytically inversed-concentration distribution overestimates the "real" concentration distribution. A better fit of the estimated concentration distribution to the "real" one is observed when the transport time period increases, i.e. when the advective front has already crossed the ICP. However, for higher dispersivity values, underestimation of the real concentration distribution is observed. Deviation of the inversed-concentration distribution from the "real" one is assessed for a site-specific concentration gradient term. A concentration gradient adjusted contaminant mass flux is thus formulated to evaluate groundwater contamination levels at a given time period through an ICP. This concentration gradient ratio can indicate whether the ICP is well positioned to evaluate accurately contaminant mass fluxes which are representative of groundwater contamination levels.},

abstract = {Model selection should be based not solely on goodness-of-fit, but must also consider model complexity. While the goal of mathematical modeling in cognitive psychology is to select one model from a set of competing models that best captures the underlying mental process, choosing the model that best fits a particular set of data will not achieve this goal. This is because a highly complex model can provide a good fit without necessarily bearing any interpretable relationship with the underlying process. It is shown that model selection based solely on the fit to observed data will result in the choice of an unnecessarily complex model that overfits the data, and thus generalizes poorly. The effect of over-fitting must be properly offset by model selection methods. An application example of selection methods using artificial data is also presented. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {
Diffusion of dissolved contaminants in multilayer porous media is an important phenomenon affecting both contamination and remediation in natural aqueous environments, including diffusion in groundwater aquitards and contaminated bed sediments. This study presents a new analytical solution for solute diffusion in a semi-infinite two-layer porous medium for arbitrary boundary and initial conditions. The solution was obtained by using the Green's function approach in the Laplace domain with the application of the binomial theorem to facilitate inversion back to the real time domain. Results based on this solution were found to be simple both in form and ease of calculation and to be in good agreement with those obtained using numerical calculations based on the Crank-Nicolson finite difference method. Applications of the solution are presented in the context of a contaminated groundwater aquitard to demonstrate how different boundary and initial conditions can greatly affect the contamination and decontamination of porous media, and to illustrate how diffusion modeling might be used in a forensic sense.},

abstract = {This article proposes a method for nonparametric estimation of hazard rates as a function of time and possibly multiple covariates. The method is based on dividing the time axis into intervals, and calculating number of event and follow-up time contributions from the different intervals. The number of event and follow-up time data are then separately smoothed on time and the covariates, and the hazard rate estimators obtained by taking the ratio. Pointwise consistency and asymptotic normality are shown for the hazard rate estimators for a certain class of smoothers, which includes some standard approaches to locally weighted regression and kernel regression. It is shown through simulation that a variance estimator based on this asymptotic distribution is reasonably reliable in practice. The problem of how to select the smoothing parameter is considered, but a satisfactory resolution to this problem has not been identified. The method is illustrated using data from several breast cancer clinical trials.},

@article{Flach2004,
abstract = {Subgrid modeling of some type is typically used to account for heterogeneity at scales below the grid scale. The single-domain model (SDM), employing field-scale dispersion, and the dual-domain model (DDM), employing local hydrodynamic dispersion and exchange between domains having large hydraulic conductivity contrasts, are well-known examples. In this paper, the two modeling approaches are applied to tritium migration from the H-area seepage basins to a nearby stream--Fourmile Branch--at the Savannah River Site. This location has been monitored since 1955, so an extensive dataset exists for formulating realistic simulations and comparing the results to data. It is concluded that the main parameters of both models are scale-dependent, and methods are discussed for making initial estimates of the DDM parameters, which include mobile/immobile porosities and the mass exchange coefficient. Both models were calibrated to produce the best fit to recorded tritium data. When various attributes of the dataset were considered, including cumulative tritium activity discharged to Fourmile Branch, plume arrival time, and plume attenuation due to closure of the seepage basins in 1988, the DDM produced results superior to the SDM, while causing no unrealistic upgradient dispersion. A sensitivity analysis showed that only the DDM was able to accurately produce both the instantaneous activity discharge and cumulative activity with a single parameter set. This is thought to be due to the advection-dominated nature of transport in natural porous media and the more realistic treatment of this type of transport in the DDM relative to the SDM.},

@article{Foglia2007,
abstract = {Many methods can be used to test alternative ground water models. Of concern in this work are methods able to (1) rank alternative models (also called model discrimination) and (2) identify observations important to parameter estimates and predictions (equivalent to the purpose served by some types of sensitivity analysis). Some of the measures investigated are computationally efficient; others are computationally demanding. The latter are generally needed to account for model nonlinearity. The efficient model discrimination methods investigated include the information criteria: the corrected Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, and generalized cross-validation. The efficient sensitivity analysis measures used are dimensionless scaled sensitivity (DSS), composite scaled sensitivity, and parameter correlation coefficient (PCC); the other statistics are DFBETAS, Cook's D, and observation-prediction statistic. Acronyms are explained in the introduction. Cross-validation (CV) is a computationally intensive nonlinear method that is used for both model discrimination and sensitivity analysis. The methods are tested using up to five alternative parsimoniously constructed models of the ground water system of the Maggia Valley in southern Switzerland. The alternative models differ in their representation of hydraulic conductivity. A new method for graphically representing CV and sensitivity analysis results for complex models is presented and used to evaluate the utility of the efficient statistics. The results indicate that for model selection, the information criteria produce similar results at much smaller computational cost than CV. For identifying important observations, the only obviously inferior linear measure is DSS; the poor performance was expected because DSS does not include the effects of parameter correlation and PCC reveals large parameter correlations.},

@article{Santschi2004,
abstract = {Iodine is a biophilic element, with several short-lived isotopes (e.g. (131)I, t(1/2)=8 days), one long-lived isotope, (129)I (t(1/2)=15.6 million years) and one stable isotope, (127)I. The inventory of (129)I in surface environments has been overwhelmed by anthropogenic releases over the past 50 years. Iodine and its isotopes are important for a number of reasons: (1) The largest fraction of the short-term and long-term dose from accidental releases and fallout from atomic bomb tests was from iodine isotopes. (2) (129)I is one of the two long-lived nuclides with highest mobility in stored radioactive waste. (3) (129)I could provide the scientific community with a new geochemical tracer and new geochronological applications in environmental science. (4) A better assessment of iodine deficiency disorders, mineralization in exploration geochemistry, and the transfer of volatile organic greenhouse-active and ozone-destroying iodine species from the oceans to the atmosphere is needed. One of the most promising future applications for the (129)I/(127)I ratio is not only as a new geochronometer, but also as a new source tracer for terrestrial organic matter with ages of 50 years or less. This is especially attractive, since radiocarbon can be, at times, an ambiguous chronometer for the 50-year time-scale, whereas (129)I concentrations during this time are overwhelming previous levels by orders of magnitude. Iodine is to a significant extent involved in the cycle of organic matter in all surface environments. Its biophilic nature is demonstrated by a relative enrichment of iodine in seaweed and dissolved macromolecular organic matter. Because of the close coupling of iodine and organic carbon cycles, our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of the processes regulating iodination reactions in aquatic systems is still limited. The binding of iodine by organic matter has the potential to modify the transport, bioavailability and transfer of iodine isotopes to man. Equilibration times for (129)I in many reservoirs are likely long enough that (129)I could be used as a new source tracer for organic matter of terrestrial origin, and as a geochronometer. Current tracer applications of (129)I are limited by our knowledge of the effects of UV-radiation, microbial activity and geochemical redox conditions on organo-I compounds and overall iodine speciation. The biogeochemical behavior of iodine and its isotopes appears to be different in North America and European waters, possibly due to climatic, source and speciation differences.},

@article{Posada2004,
abstract = {Model selection is a topic of special relevance in molecular phylogenetics that affects many, if not all, stages of phylogenetic inference. Here we discuss some fundamental concepts and techniques of model selection in the context of phylogenetics. We start by reviewing different aspects of the selection of substitution models in phylogenetics from a theoretical, philosophical and practical point of view, and summarize this comparison in table format. We argue that the most commonly implemented model selection approach, the hierarchical likelihood ratio test, is not the optimal strategy for model selection in phylogenetics, and that approaches like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian methods offer important advantages. In particular, the latter two methods are able to simultaneously compare multiple nested or nonnested models, assess model selection uncertainty, and allow for the estimation of phylogenies and model parameters using all available models (model-averaged inference or multimodel inference). We also describe how the relative importance of the different parameters included in substitution models can be depicted. To illustrate some of these points, we have applied AIC-based model averaging to 37 mitochondrial DNA sequences from the subgenus Ohomopterus(genus Carabus) ground beetles described by Sota and Vogler (2001).},

abstract = {Traditionally, models are compared on the basis of their accuracy, their scope, and their simplicity. Simplicity is often represented by parameter counts; the fewer the parameters, the simpler the model. Arguments are presented here suggesting that simplicity has little place in discussions of modeling; instead, the concept of flexibility should be substituted. When comparing two models one should be wary of the possibility of their differential flexibility. Several methods for assessing relative flexibility are possible, as represented in this special issue of the Journal of Mathematical Psychology. Here, the method of cross-validation is applied in the comparison of two models, a linear integration model (LIM) and the fuzzy-logical model of perception (FLMP), in the fitting of 44 data sets concerning the perception of layout seen among three panels with the presence or absence of four sources of information for depth. Prior to cross-validation the two models performed about equally well; after cross-validation LIM was statistically superior to FLMP, but the overall pattern of fits remained nearly the same for both models.

@article{Hartmann2007,
abstract = {A multi-borehole radial tracer test has been conducted in the confined Chalk aquifer of E. Yorkshire, UK. Three different tracer dyes were injected into three injection boreholes and a central borehole, 25 m from the injection boreholes, was pumped at 330 m(3)/d for 8 days. The breakthrough curves show that initial breakthrough and peak times were fairly similar for all dyes but that recoveries varied markedly from 9 to 57\%. The breakthrough curves show a steep rise to a peak and long tail, typical of dual porosity aquifers. The breakthrough curves were simulated using a 1D dual porosity model. Model input parameters were constrained to acceptable ranges determined from estimations of matrix porosity and diffusion coefficient, fracture spacing, initial breakthrough times and bulk transmissivity of the aquifer. The model gave equivalent hydraulic apertures for fractures in the range 363-384 microm, dispersivities of 1 to 5 m and matrix block sizes of 6 to 9 cm. Modelling suggests that matrix block size is the primary controlling parameter for solute transport in the aquifer, particularly for recovery. The observed breakthrough curves suggest results from single injection-borehole tracer tests in the Chalk may give initial breakthrough and peak times reasonably representative of the aquifer but that recovery is highly variable and sensitive to injection and abstraction borehole location. Consideration of aquifer heterogeneity suggests that high recoveries may be indicative of a high flow pathway adjacent, but not necessarily connected, to the injection and abstraction boreholes whereas low recoveries may indicate more distributed flow through many fractures of similar aperture.},

abstract = {The Akaike information criterion (AIC; Akaike, 1973) is a popular method for comparing the adequacy of multiple, possibly nonnested models. Current practice in cognitive psychology is to accept a single model on the basis of only the "raw" AIC values, making it difficult to unambiguously interpret the observed AIC differences in terms of a continuous measure such as probability. Here we demonstrate that AIC values can be easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike, 1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham \& Anderson, 2002), which can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each model. We show by example how these Akaike weights can greatly facilitate the interpretation of the results of AIC model comparison procedures.},

@article{Carrera1993a,
abstract = {Groundwater flow and solute transport are often driven by heterogeneities that elude easy identification. It is also difficult to select and describe the physico-chemical processes controlling solute behavior. As a result, definition of a conceptual model involves numerous assumptions both on the selection of processes and on the representation of their spatial variability. Even if a unique conceptual model could be identified, estimation of its parameters may be highly uncertain. Using a calibrated model for making groundwater predictions involves three types of uncertainties: those associated with the correctness of the conceptual model, which may arise during model construction or during prediction; those related to the accuracy of model parameters; and those corresponding to uncertainties in future stresses. In this context, validating a numerical model by comparing its predictions with actual measurements may not be sufficient for evaluting whether or not it provides a good representation of ‘reality’. Predictions will be close to measurements, regardless of model validity, if these are taken from experiments that stress well-calibrated model modes. On the other hand, predictions will be far from measurements when model parameters are very uncertain, even if the model is indeed a very good representation of the real system. Hence, we contend that ‘classical’ validation of hydrogeological models is not possible. Rather, models should be viewed as theories about the real system. This can be proven wrong, but they cannot be proven right. In this sense, we propose to follow a rigorous modeling approach in which different sources of uncertainty are explicitly recognized. The application of one such approach is illustrated by modeling a laboratory uranium tracer test performed on fresh granite, which was used as Test Case 1b in INTRAVAL.},

Many water security applications, including sensor placement optimization, require detailed simulation of potential contamination incidents. The post-simulation optimization problem can easily exceed memory on standard desktop computers. Large networks can be skeletonized to reduce computation; however, this alters network hydraulics and, therefore, sensor placement. The objective of this paper is to evaluate a two-tiered sensor placement approach that combines hydraulic and water quality simulations using “all-pipes”, or original, network models with subsequent geographic aggregation of time and impact values to reduce memory requirements. The two-tiered approach first places sensors on aggregated regions, then refines the solution to actual nodes in the original model. The two-tiered sensor placement approach is compared to results using the original n...},

@article{Kirchner2000,
abstract = {The time it takes for rainfall to travel through a catchment and reach the stream is a fundamental hydraulic parameter that controls the retention of soluble contaminants and thus the downstream consequences of pollution episodes. Catchments with short flushing times will deliver brief, intense contaminant pulses to downstream waters, whereas catchments with longer flushing times will deliver less intense but more sustained contaminant fluxes. Here we analyse detailed time series of chloride, a natural tracer, in both rainfall and runoff from headwater catchments at Plynlimon, Wales. We show that, although the chloride concentrations in rainfall have a white noise spectrum, the chloride concentrations in streamflow exhibit fractal 1/f scaling over three orders of magnitude. The fractal fluctuations in tracer concentrations indicate that these catchments do not have characteristic flushing times. Instead, their travel times follow an approximate power-law distribution implying that they will retain a long chemical memory of past inputs. Contaminants will initially be flushed rapidly, but then low-level contamination will be delivered to streams for a surprisingly long time.},

@article{Finsterle2011,
abstract = {We propose a modification to the Levenberg–Marquardt minimization algorithm for a more robust and more efficient calibration of highly parameterized, strongly nonlinear models of multiphase flow through porous media. The new method combines the advantages of truncated singular value decomposition with those of the classical Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, thus enabling a more robust solution of underdetermined inverse problems with complex relations between the parameters to be estimated and the observable state variables used for calibration. The truncation limit separating the solution space from the calibration null space is re-evaluated during the iterative calibration process. In between these re-evaluations, fewer forward simulations are required, compared to the standard approach, to calculate the approximate sensitivity matrix. Truncated singular values are used to calculate the Levenberg–Marquardt parameter updates, ensuring that safe small steps along the steepest-descent direction are taken for highly correlated parameters of low sensitivity, whereas efficient quasi-Gauss–Newton steps are taken for independent parameters with high impact. The performance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated for a synthetic data set representing infiltration into a partially saturated, heterogeneous soil, where hydrogeological, petrophysical, and geostatistical parameters are estimated based on the joint inversion of hydrological and geophysical data.},

@article{Carrera1993,
abstract = {Model predictions are uncertain because of uncertainties on future and/or anthropogenic stresses, parameter values and conceptual models. The first two groups of problems can be addressed through rather systematic methods (scenario analysis, error transmission techniques, automatic calibration algorithms, etc.). However, conceptual uncertainties are rarely given adequate attention. The objective of this paper is to synthesize conceptual difficulties associated with transport. These include: (1) processes that are significant at small scales may not be relevant at large scales; (2) inversely, new processes (e.g., dispersion) emerge in response to increase in scale and the way to represent them may depend on the assumed model structure; (3) the observed shapes of both breakthrough curves and pollutant plumes are not well represented by the classical transport equation; (4) porosities and dispersivities derived from field tracer tests often exhibit a directional dependence; etc. Though not directly related to solute transport, scale effects on hydraulic conductivity may also affect solute transport modelling. When these anomalies are examined, it is concluded that they are directly or indirectly caused by heterogeneity. Current approaches for dealing with heterogeneity can be divided into stochastic and deterministic. Stochastic methods have been successful in explaining qualitatively some anomalies of solute transport, but they appear to be far from reaching a stage at which they can be used routinely for solving realistic field problems. On the other hand, when applied with care, deterministic methods have been successfully used in actual problems. Yet, it can be argued that they fail to account for small-scale variability of concentrations so that they would become ineffective when dealing with nonlinear processes, such as chemical reactions. Relevance of on-going research for overcoming these difficulties is discussed.},

abstract = {Iodine is an important element in studies of environmental protection
and human health, global-scale hydrologic processes and nuclear nonproliferation.
Biogeochemical cycling of iodine is complex, because iodine occurs
in multiple oxidation states and as inorganic and organic species
that may be hydrophilic, atmophilic, and biophilic. In this study,
we applied new analytical techniques to study the sorption and transport
behavior of iodine species (iodide, iodate, and 4-iodoaniline) in
sediments collected at the Savannah River and Hanford Sites, where
anthropogenic 129I from prior nuclear fuel processing activities
poses an environmental risk. We conducted integrated column and batch
experiments to investigate the interconversion, sorption and transport
of iodine species, and the sediments we examined exhibit a wide range
in organic matter, clay mineralogy, soil pH, and texture. The results
of our experiments illustrate complex behavior with various processes
occurring, including iodate reduction, irreversible retention or
mass loss of iodide, and rate-limited and nonlinear sorption. There
was an appreciable iodate reduction to iodide, presumably mediated
by the structural Fe(II) in some clay minerals; therefore, careful
attention must be given to potential interconversion among species
when interpreting the biogeochemical behavior of iodine in the environment.
The different iodine species exhibited dramatically different sorption
and transport behavior in three sediment samples, possessing different
physico-chemical properties, collected from different depths at the
Savannah River Site. Our study yielded additional insight into processes
and mechanisms affecting the geochemical cycling of iodine in the
environment, and provided quantitative estimates of key parameters
(e.g., extent and rate of sorption) for risk assessment at these
sites.},

abstract = {In certain hydrogeological situations, fluid density variations occur because of changes in the solute or colloidal concentration, temperature, and pressure of the groundwater. These include seawater intrusion, high-level radioactive waste disposal, groundwater contamination, and geothermal energy production. When the density of the invading fluid is greater than that of the ambient one, density-driven free convection can lead to transport of heat and solutes over larger spatial scales and significantly shorter time scales than compared with diffusion alone. Beginning with the work of Lord Rayleigh in 1916, thermal and solute instabilities in homogeneous media have been studied in detail for almost a century. Recently, these theoretical and experimental studies have been applied in the study of groundwater phenomena, where the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy rarely, if ever, apply. The critical role that heterogeneity plays in the onset as well as the growth and/or decay of convective motion is discussed by way of a review of pertinent literature and numerical simulations performed using a variable-density flow and solute transport numerical code. Different styles of heterogeneity are considered and range from continuously "trending" heterogeneity (sinusoidal and stochastic permeability distributions) to discretely fractured geologic media. Results indicate that both the onset of instabilities and their subsequent growth and decay are intimately related to the structure and variance of the permeability field. While disordered heterogeneity tends to dissipate convection through dispersive mixing, an ordered heterogeneity (e.g., sets of vertical fractures) allows instabilities to propagate at modest combinations of fracture aperture and separation distances. Despite a clearer understanding of the processes that control the onset and propagation of instabilities, resultant plume patterns and their migration rates and pathways do not appear amenable to prediction at present. The classical Rayleigh number used to predict the occurrence of instabilities fails, in most cases, when heterogeneous conditions prevail. The incorporation of key characteristics of the heterogeneous permeability field into relevant stability criteria and numerical models remains a challenge for future research.},

@article{Hatfield2004,
abstract = {This paper introduces a new direct method for measuring water and contaminant fluxes in porous media. The method uses a passive flux meter (PFM), which is essentially a self-contained permeable unit properly sized to fit tightly in a screened well or boring. The meter is designed to accommodate a mixed medium of hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic permeable sorbents, which retain dissolved organic/inorganic contaminants present in the groundwater flowing passively through the meter. The contaminant mass intercepted and retained on the sorbent is used to quantify cumulative contaminant mass flux. The sorptive matrix is also impregnated with known amounts of one or more water soluble 'resident tracers'. These tracers are displaced from the sorbent at rates proportional to the groundwater flux; hence, in the current meter design, the resident tracers are used to quantify cumulative groundwater flux. Theory is presented and quantitative tools are developed to interpret the water flux from tracers possessing linear and nonlinear elution profiles. The same theory is extended to derive functional relationships useful for quantifying cumulative contaminant mass flux. To validate theory and demonstrate the passive flux meter, results of multiple box-aquifer experiments are presented and discussed. From these experiments, it is seen that accurate water flux measurements are obtained when the tracer used in calculations resides in the meter at levels representing 20 to 70 percent of the initial condition. 2,4-Dimethyl-3-pentanol (DMP) is used as a surrogate groundwater contaminant in the box aquifer experiments. Cumulative DMP fluxes are measured within 5\% of known fluxes. The accuracy of these estimates generally increases with the total volume of water intercepted.},

abstract = {A substantial reservoir (up to 1 kg ha(-1)) of natural perchlorate is present in diverse unsaturated zones of the arid and semi-arid southwestern United States. The perchlorate co-occurs with meteoric chloride that has accumulated in these soils throughout the Holocene [0 to 10-15 ka (thousand years ago)] and possibly longer periods. Previously, natural perchlorate widely believed to be limited to the Atacama Desert, now appears widespread in steppe-to-desert ecoregions. The perchlorate reservoir becomes sufficiently large to affect groundwater when recharge from irrigation or climate change flushes accumulated salts from the unsaturated zone. This new source may help explain increasing reports of perchlorate in dry region agricultural products and should be considered when evaluating overall source contributions.},

abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of electronic waste, current status of the management of electronic waste (e-waste), and recycling technologies for the recovery of metals from end-of-life electronic equipment. Because of the ever increasing generation of e-waste and the hazardous nature of this waste stream, e-waste is an emerging issue. Many countries have drafted legislation to improve the reuse, recycling, and other forms of recovery of such waste. Electronic waste is significantly heterogeneous and complex in terms of the type of components and materials. However, copper and precious metals make up more than 80\% of the value for most of the e-waste samples. This indicates that the recovery of precious metals and copper may remain as the major economic driver for a long time. The hierarchy of treatment of e-waste encourages the reuse of the whole equipment first, remanufacturing, then recovery of materials by recycling techniques, and as a last resort, disposal by incineration and landfilling. Recycling of e-waste can be broadly divided into three major steps—selective disassembly, targeting, and singling out hazardous or valuable components for special treatment; mechanical and metallurgical processing to upgrade desirable materials content; and refining recovered materials that are retreated or purified by using chemical (metallurgical) processing so as to be acceptable for further use in their original application.},

abstract = {Arsenic compounds have been applied at the land surface as pesticides in agricultural areas globally. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the fate of anthropogenic arsenic applications related to agriculture, using arsenic applications on cotton in the southern High Plains (SHP), Texas, as a case study and examining possible linkages with contamination of the underlying Ogallala aquifer in this region, where 36\% of wells exceed the new EPA 10 microg/L standard. Unsaturated zone soil samples were collected from boreholes beneath natural ecosystems (grassland/ shrubland) to provide a control (no arsenic application) (5 profiles) and cotton cropland (20 profiles) for analyses of water-extractable arsenic, vanadium, phosphate, chloride, and nitrate. Natural ecosystem profiles have high arsenic concentrations at depth (maximum of 7.2-69.6 microg As/ kg dry soil at 5.9-21.4 m depth) that are attributed to a geologic source. Most profiles beneath cotton cropland have high arsenic concentrations within the upper meter (profile means 1.7 to 31.6 microg/kg) that correlate with phosphate (r = 0.70, p < 0.01) and are attributed to anthropogenic arsenic application associated with phosphate fertilizer application. High arsenic concentrations at >1 m depth (profile means < or =36.3 microg/kg) found in cropland profiles are attributed to a geologic source because of similarity with profiles beneath natural ecosystems, lack of correlation with phosphate, and pore-water ages that predate anthropogenic arsenic application in many profiles. GIS analyses showed poor correlations between groundwater arsenic and percent cultivated land (r = -0.15, p < 0.01), groundwater nitrate (r = 0.30, p < 0.01), and water table depth (r= -0.31, p < 0.01), further supporting the idea that anthropogenic-derived arsenic in the shallow subsurface is not linked to groundwater arsenic contamination in this region.},

abstract = {This work presents a comparative assessment of efficient uncertainty modeling techniques, including Stochastic Response Surface Method (SRSM) and High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR). This assessment considers improvement achieved with respect to conventional techniques of modeling uncertainty (Monte Carlo). Given that traditional methods for characterizing uncertainty are very computationally demanding, when they are applied in conjunction with complex environmental fate and transport models, this study aims to assess how accurately these efficient (and hence viable) techniques for uncertainty propagation can capture complex model output uncertainty. As a part of this effort, the efficacy of HDMR, which has primarily been used in the past as a model reduction tool, is also demonstrated for uncertainty analysis. The application chosen to highlight the accuracy of these new techniques is the steady state analysis of the groundwater flow in the Savannah River Site General Separations Area (GSA) using the subsurface Flow And Contaminant Transport (FACT) code. Uncertain inputs included three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity fields, and a two-dimensional recharge rate field. The output variables under consideration were the simulated stream baseflows and hydraulic head values. Results show that the uncertainty analysis outcomes obtained using SRSM andHDMRare practically indistinguishable from those obtained using the conventional Monte Carlo method, while requiring orders of magnitude fewer model simulations.},

@article{Bolster2008,
abstract = {We present a general framework for probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) of building contamination. PRA provides a powerful tool for the rigorous quantification of risk in contamination of building spaces. A typical PRA starts by identifying relevant components of a system (e.g. ventilation system components, potential sources of contaminants, remediation methods) and proceeds by using available information and statistical inference to estimate the probabilities of their failure. These probabilities are then combined by means of fault-tree analyses to yield probabilistic estimates of the risk of system failure (e.g. building contamination). A sensitivity study of PRAs can identify features and potential problems that need to be addressed with the most urgency. Often PRAs are amenable to approximations, which can significantly simplify the approach. All these features of PRA are presented in this paper via a simple illustrative example, which can be built upon in further studies. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The tool presented here can be used to design and maintain adequate ventilation systems to minimize exposure of occupants to contaminants.},

abstract = {Field and laboratory studies were carried out to understand the cause for steady increases in (129)I concentrations emanating from radiological basins located on the Savannah River Site, South Carolina. The basins were closed in 1988 by adding limestone and slag and then capping with a low permeability engineered cover. Groundwater (129)I concentrations in a well near the basins in 1993 were 200 pCi L(-1) and are presently between 400 and 1000 pCi L(-1). Iodine speciation in the plume contained wide ranges of iodide, iodate, and organo-iodine concentrations. First-order calculations based on a basin sediment desorption study indicate that the modest increase of 0.7 pH units detected in the study site groundwater over the last 17 years since closure of the basins may be sufficient to produce the observed increased groundwater (129)I concentrations near the basins. Groundwater monitoring of the plume at the basins has shown that the migration of many of the high risk radionuclides originally present at this complex site has been attenuated. However, (129)I continues to leave the source at a rate that may have been exacerbated by the initial remediation efforts. This study underscores the importance of identifying the appropriate in situ stabilization technologies for all source contaminants, especially if their geochemical behaviors differ.},

abstract = {Several parameter estimation problems (or “inverse” problems) such as those that occur in hydrology and geophysics are solved using partial differential equation (PDE)-based models of the physical system in question. Likewise, these problems are usually underdetermined due to the lack of enough data to constrain a unique solution. In this paper, we present a framework for the solution of underdetermined inverse problems using COMSOL Multiphysics (formerly FEMLAB) that is applicable to a broad range of physical systems governed by PDEs. We present a general adjoint state formulation which may be used in this framework and allows for faster calculation of sensitivity matrices in a variety of commonly encountered underdetermined problems. The aim of this approach is to provide a platform for the solution of inverse problems that is efficient, flexible, and not restricted to one particular scientific application.  We present an example application of this framework on a synthetic underdetermined inverse problem in aquifer characterization, and present numerical results on the accuracy and efficiency of this method. Our results indicate that our COMSOL-based routines provide an accurate, flexible, and scalable method for the solution of PDE-based inverse problems.},

abstract = {Adsorption of Ni and Pb on aquifer sediments from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA increased with increasing pH and metal-ion concentration. Adsorption could be described quantitatively using a semi-mechanistic surface complexation model (SCM), in which adsorption is described using chemical reactions between metal ions and adsorption sites. Equilibrium reactive transport simulations incorporating the SCMs, formation of metal-ion-EDTA complexes, and either Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide solubility or Zn desorption from sediments identified important factors responsible for trends observed during transport experiments conducted with EDTA complexes of Ni, Zn, and Pb in the Cape Cod aquifer. Dissociation of Pb-EDTA by Fe(III) is more favorable than Ni-EDTA because of differences in Ni- and Pb-adsorption to the sediments. Dissociation of Ni-EDTA becomes more favorable with decreasing Ni-EDTA concentration and decreasing pH. In contrast to Ni, Pb-EDTA can be dissociated by Zn desorbed from the aquifer sediments. Variability in adsorbed Zn concentrations has a large impact on Pb-EDTA dissociation.},

abstract = {This Chapter explores military waste issues. It focuses on the issues associated with the United States Army from existing military facilities and from base camp operations. The Army has facilities to house and train troops, store munitions, support operational commands, conduct research and development, and engage in the production of munitions. Of course, many facilities combine several aspects of these activities. Within these facilities, a wide range of activities can take place, each of which may result in the generation of various waste streams. These include typical household wastes from housing areas, office wastes from various administrative and command activities, landscaping wastes, and construction and demolition (C\&D) wastes. Therefore, in many ways, wastes generated at military facilities are similar to civilian residential communities and commercial facilities. However, training areas in particular provide substantially different waste issues than commonly found in civilian environments. Another area of substantial difference is the management of explosive munitions, particularly the decommissioning of out-of-specification materials.},

abstract = {Sodium bentonites are used as barrier materials for the isolation of landfills and are under consideration for a similar use in the subsurface storage of high-level radioactive waste. The performance of these barriers is determined in large part by molecular diffusion in the bentonite pore space. We tested two current models of cation diffusion in bentonite against experimental data on the relative apparent diffusion coefficients of two representative cations, sodium and strontium. On the "macropore/nanopore" model, solute molecules are divided into two categories, with unequal pore-scale diffusion coefficients, based on location: in macropores or in interlayer nanopores. On the "surface diffusion" model, solute molecules are divided into categories based on chemical speciation: dissolved or adsorbed. The macropore/nanopore model agrees with all experimental data at partial montmorillonite dry densities ranging from 0.2 (a dilute bentonite gel) to 1.7 kg dm(-3) (a highly compacted bentonite with most of its pore space located in interlayer nanopores), whereas the surface diffusion model fails at partial montmorillonite dry densities greater than about 1.3 kg dm(-3).},

abstract = {A simple and rapid method has been developed to simultaneously measure sub-microg/L quantities of the oxyhalide anions bromate, chlorate, iodate, and perchlorate in water samples. Water samples (10 mL) are passed through barium and hydronium cartridges to remove sulfate and carbonate, respectively. The method utilizes the direct injection of 10 microL volumes of water samples into a liquid chromatography-tandem triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system. Ionization is accomplished using electrospray ionization in negative mode. The method detection limits were 0.021 microg/L for perchlorate, 0.045 microg/L for bromate, 0.070 microg/L for iodate, and 0.045 microg/L for chlorate anions in water. The LC-MS/MS method described here was compared to established EPA methods 300.1 and 317.1 for bromate analysis and EPA method 314.0 for perchlorate analysis. Samples collected from sites with known contamination were split and sent to certified laboratories utilizing EPA methods for bromate and perchlorate analysis. At concentrations above the reporting limits for EPA methods, the method described here was always within 20\% of the established methods, and generally within 10\%. Twenty-one commercially available bottled waters were analyzed for oxyhalides. The majority of bottled waters contained detectable levels of oxyhalides, with perchlorate < or = 0.74 microg/L, bromate < or = 76 microg/L, iodate < or = 25 microg/ L, and chlorate < or = 5.8 microg/L. Perchlorate, iodate, and chlorate were detectable in nearly all natural waters tested, while bromate was only detected in treated waters. Perchlorate was found in several rivers and reservoirs where itwas not found previously using EPA 314.0 (reporting limit of 4 microg/L). This method was also applied to common detergents used for cleaning laboratory glassware and equipmentto evaluate the potential for sample contamination. Only chlorate appeared as a major oxyhalide in the detergents evaluated, with concentrations up to 517 microg/g. Drinking water treatment plants were also evaluated using this method. Significant formations of chlorate and bromate are demonstrated from hypochlorite generation and ozonation. From the limited data set provided here, it appears that perchlorate is a ubiquitous contaminant of natural waters at trace levels.},

abstract = {Air pollution is the presence of contaminants or substances in the air that interfere with human health or welfare, or produce other harmful environmental effects. This chapter focuses on the waste streams that affect the atmosphere. The predominant concern with atmospheric waste is chemical contamination, which presents a hazard to human health. Thus, public health is usually the principal driver for assessing and controlling air contaminants. However, air pollution abatement laws and programs have also recognized that effects beyond health are also important, especially welfare protection. One of the main welfare considerations is that ecosystems are important receptors of contamination. Another welfare concern is that contaminants impact structures and other engineered systems by corrosion. Thus, from an air pollution perspective, there is a cascade of hazards from human health to ecosystems to abiotic (i.e., nonliving) systems. As far as pollution control is concerned, air pollution control must be strategic and tactical. The former is the long-term reduction of pollution levels at all scales of the problem from local to global. Goals can be set for air quality improvement 5, 10, or 15 years ahead and plans can be made to achieve these improvements.},

abstract = {At the Savannah River Site's F-Area, wastewaters containing radionuclides were disposed into seepage basins for decades. After closure and capping in 1991, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has being monitoring and remediating the groundwater plume. Despite numerous studies of the plume, its persistence for over 20 years has not been well understood. To better understand the plume dynamics, a limited number of deep boreholes were drilled to determine the current plume characteristics. A mixing model was developed to predict plume tritium and nitrate concentrations. We found that the plume trailing edges have emerged for some contaminants, and that contaminant recharge from the basin's vadose zone is still important. The model's estimated time-dependent basin drainage rates combined with dilution from natural recharge successfully predicted plume tritium and nitrate concentrations. This new understanding of source zone influences can help guide science-based remediation, and improve predictions of the natural attenuation timeframes.},

abstract = {Historically, waste management has been inextricably linked with the evolution of human communities, population growth, and the emergence and development of commerce. During the past century, consumption and production patterns have changed radically—due in part to the greater freedom of movement of money, goods, and people. A horizontal framework has been established for waste management, including definitions and principles. Treatment operations were defined vertically—to include the control of landfill and incineration. A body of standards is currently being prepared for treatment operations—through the International Standards Organization, with support from national standards bodies. Reuse and recycling are being integrated into industrial activities. However, as they are interpreted today, the concepts of reuse and recycling are inextricably linked to the production and management of waste and by extension, to its prevention and minimization. Reuse and recycling have evolved into two of the four pillars that support improved resource management through the prevention of waste and the reuse, recycling, and recovery of the wastes that do occur to achieve sustainable developmental goals by reducing reliance on natural resources.},

abstract = {
Bioavailability often controls the fate of organic contaminants in surface and subsurface aquatic environments. Bioavailability can be limited by sorption, mass transfer, and intrinsic biodegradation potential and can be further altered by the presence of other compounds. This paper reviews current perspectives on the processes influencing subsurface contaminant bioavailability, how these processes are modeled, and how the relative role of the various processes can be assessed through bioavailability indices. Although these processes are increasingly well understood, the use of sophisticated models and indices often are precluded by an inability to estimate the many parameters that are associated with complex models. Nonetheless, the proper representation of sorption, mass transfer, biodegradation, and co-solute effects can be critical in predicting bio-attenuation. The influence of these processes on contaminant fate is illustrated with numerical simulations for the simultaneous degradation of toluene (growth substrate) and trichloroethylene (nongrowth cometabolite) in hypothetical, aerobic, solid-water systems. The results show how the relative impacts on contaminant fate of the model's various component processes depends upon system conditions, including co-solute concentrations. Slow biodegradation rates increase the inhibition effects of a cometabolite and suppress the rate enhancement effects of a growth substrate. Irrespective of co-solute effects, contaminant fate is less sensitive to biodegradation processes in systems with strong sorption and slow desorption rates. Bioavailability indices can be used to relate these findings and to help identify appropriate modeling simplifications. In general, however, there remains a need to redefine such indices in order that bioavailability concepts can be better incorporated into site characterization, remediation design, and regulatory oversight.},

abstract = {Tracer tests were performed in distinct biogeochemical zones of a sand and gravel aquifer in Cape Cod, MA, to study the redox chemistry (I) and transport (Cs, I) of cesium and iodine in a field setting. Injection of iodide (I(-)) into an oxic zone of the aquifer resulted in oxidation of I(-) to molecular iodine (I(2)) and iodate (10(3)(-)) over transport distances of several meters. Oxidation is attributed to Mn-oxides present in the sediment Transport of injected 10(3)(-) and Cs(+) was retarded in the mildly acidic oxic zone, with retardation factors of 1.6-1.8 for 10(3)(-) and 2.3-4.4 for Cs. Cs retardation was likely due to cation exchange reactions. Injection of 10(3)(-) into a Fe-reducing zone of the aquifer resulted in rapid and complete reduction to I(-) within 3 m of transport. Then on conservative behavior of Cs and I observed during the tracer tests underscores the necessity of taking the redox chemistry of I as well as sorption properties of I species and Cs into account when predicting transport of radionuclides (e.g., (129)I and (137)Cs) in the environment.},

@article{Jarsjo2005,
abstract = {Field-scale characterisations of contaminant plumes in groundwater, as well as source zone delineations, are associated with uncertainties that can be considerable. A major source of uncertainty in environmental datasets is due to variability of sampling results, as a direct consequence of the heterogeneity of environmental matrices. We develop a methodology for quantifying uncertainties in field-scale mass flow and average concentration estimations, using integral pumping tests (IPTs), where the contaminant concentration is measured as a function of time in a pumping well. This procedure increases the sampling volume and reduces the effect of small-scale variability that may bias point-scale measurements. In particular, using IPTs, the interpolation uncertainty of conventional point-scale measurements is transformed to a quantifiable uncertainty related to the (unknown) plume position relative to the pumping well. We show that this plume position uncertainty generally influenced the predicted mass flows and average concentrations (of acenapthene, benzene and CHCs) to a greater extent than a boundary condition uncertainty related to the local water balance, considering 19 control planes at a highly heterogeneous industrial site in southwest Germany. Furthermore, large (order of magnitude) uncertainties only occurred if the conditions were strongly heterogeneous in the nearest vicinity of the well. We also develop a consistent methodology for an assessment of the combined effect of uncertainty in hydraulic conditions and uncertainty in reactive transport parameters for delimiting of both contaminant source zones and zones absent of source, based on (downgradient) IPTs.},

abstract = {The Savannah River Plant (SRP) in South Carolina is presently the largest producer of nuclear explosives in the United States. It is owned by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and has been in operation since 1952 under contract by E.l. du Pont de Nemours \& Co. In 1953 the first of five reactors was started up. In the early years of the plant's operation, mea- surements of radioactivity did not cover all emission sources or all environmental media. For example, noble gas releases from the reactor area were not measured before 1971, and continuous monitoring of milk did not begin until 1962. A population dose assessment published in 1977 in an Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) report (1) was based on release estimates only. These obstacles would make a comprehensive environmental and health study a complex endeavor. Herein, environmental doses from external gamma radiation in the SRP vicinity are analyzed using the measurements taken by Du Pont. The results of this analysis are compared with data in the ERDA report and the inconsistencies are discussed.},

@article{Beven1989,
abstract = {This paper argues that there are fundamental problems in the application of physically-based models for practical prediction in hydrology. These problems result from limitations of the model equations relative to a heterogeneous reality; the lack of a theory of subgrid scale integration; practical constraints on solution methodologies; and problems of dimensionality in parameter calibration. It is suggested that most current applications of physically-based models use them as lumped conceptual models at the grid scale. Recent papers on physically-based models have misunderstood and misrepresented these limitations. There are practical hydrological problems requiring physically-based predictions, and there will continue to be a need for physically-based models but ideas about their capabilities must change so that future applications attempt to obtain realistic estimates of the uncertainty associated with their predictions, particularly in the case of evaluating future scenarios of the effects of management strategies.},

@article{Rivett2001,
abstract = {A unique field experiment has been undertaken at the CFB Borden research site to investigate the development of dissolved chlorinated solvent plumes from a residual dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source. The "emplaced-source" tracer test methodology involved a controlled emplacement of a block-shaped source of sand containing chlorinated solvents below the water table. The gradual dissolution of this residual DNAPL solvent source under natural aquifer conditions caused dissolved solvent plumes of trichloromethane (TCM), trichloroethene (TCE) and perchloroethene (PCE) to continuously develop down gradient. Source dissolution and 3-D plume development were successfully monitored via 173 multilevel samplers over a 475-day tracer test period prior to site remediation research being initiated. Detailed groundwater level and hydraulic conductivity data were collected. Development of plumes with concentrations spanning 1-700,000 micrograms/1 is described and key processes controlling their migration identified. Plumes were observed to be narrow due to the weakness of transverse dispersion processes and long due to advection and significant longitudinal dispersion, very limited sorptive retardation and negligible, if any, attenuation due to biodegradation or abiotic reaction. TCM was shown to be essentially conservative, TCE very nearly conservative and PCE, consistent with its greater hydrophobicity, more retarded yet having a greater mobility than observed in previous Borden field tests. The absence of biodegradation was ascribed to the prevailing aerobic conditions and lack of any additional biodegradable carbon substrates. The transient groundwater flow regime caused significant transverse lateral plume movement, plume asymmetry and was likely responsible for most of the, albeit limited, transverse horizontal plume spreading. In agreement with the widespread incidence of extensive TCE and PCE plumes throughout the industrialized world, the experiment indicates such solvent plumes are likely to be highly mobile and persistent, at least in aquifers that are aerobic and have low sorption potential (low foc content).},

abstract = {The type and quantity of refuse generated by a community depends on its culture and the per capita income. Wealthy communities form throw away societies, whereas poor communities have less to throw away and are more ingenious in reusing, recycling and refurbishing articles that a wealthier community would discard. The simple but inadequate waste dumps of yesterday are still among people in most of the developing world, whereas the developed world is using the vastly improved sanitary landfill of today while planning and experimenting with and tentatively applying the still more improved landfill technology of tomorrow. The generation rate of municipal solid waste (MSW) is an important consideration in the selection of a suitably large disposal site and in the design of landfills, whether the economy is developed, developing or mixed. The sanitary landfill and the MSW of the future should have much reduced organic contents, and landfills should therefore generate less landfill gas (LFG) and (possibly) a less polluting leachate. Unfortunately, some residues will always remain, (e.g. the ash from RDF fuelled power stations) and hence the landfill will probably always remain. It is a challenge to the citizens to make the landfills of tomorrow much better, safer and less polluting than those of today.},

abstract = {Equations describing the loss of HTO from water into air and the gain of HTO in water when the overlying water vapor contains tritium but the solution does not are developed and verified by laboratory experiments. Results show that under environmental conditions, where the relative humidity is greater than 8\%, HTO is lost preferentially over HzO to the atmosphere because atmospheric moisture is virtually free of HTO. Results from a three-year study of the changes in tri- tium content of a large nonseeping outdoor basin are used to extend the laboratory studies to field situations. Data from this field study were used to calculate tritium loss from open basins. These calculations show, for example, that 90\% of the tritium contained in an aqueous stream flowing at 15,000 liters per day will be lost to the atmosphere from a shallow basin with a surface area of 6000 m.},

@article{Rivett2003,
abstract = {A natural gradient emplaced-source (ES) controlled field experiment was conducted at the Borden aquifer research site, Ontario, to study the transport of dissolved plumes emanating from residual dense nonaqueous-phase liquid (DNAPL) source zones. The specific objective of the work presented here is to determine the effects of solute and co-solute concentrations on sorption and retardation of dissolved chlorinated solvent-contaminant plumes. The ES field experiment comprised a controlled emplacement of a residual multicomponent DNAPL below the groundwater table and intensive monitoring of dissolved-phase plumes of trichloromethane (TCM), trichloroethylene (TCE), and perchloroethylene (PCE) plumes continuously generated in the aquifer down gradient from gradual source dissolution. Estimates of plume retardation (and dispersion) were obtained from 3-D numerical simulations that incorporated transient source input and flow regimes monitored during the test. PCE, the most retarded solute, surprisingly exhibited a retardation factor approximately 3 times lower than observed in a previous Borden tracer test by Mackay et al. [Water Resour. Res. 22 (1986) 2017] conducted approximately 150 m away. Also, an absence of temporal trend in PCE retardation contrasted with the previous Borden test. Supporting laboratory studies on ES site core indicated that sorption was nonlinear and competitive, i.e. reduced sorption of PCE was observed in the presence of TCE. Consideration of the effects of relatively high co-solute (TCE) concentration (competitive sorption) in addition to PCE concentration effects (nonlinear sorption) was necessary to yield laboratory-based PCE retardation estimates consistent with the field plume values. Concentration- and co-solute-based sorption and retardation analysis was also applied to the previous low-concentration pulse injection test of Mackay et al. [Water Resour. Res. 22 (1986) 2017] and was able to successfully predict the temporal field retardation trends observed in that test. While it is acknowledged that other "nonideal transport" effects may contribute, our analysis predicts differences in the PCE retardation magnitude and trend between the two experiments that are consistent with field observations based on the marked solute concentration differences that resulted from contrasting source conditions. Solute and co-solute concentration effects have heretofore received little attention, but may have wide significance in aquifers contaminated by point-source pollutants because many plumes contain mixed solutes over wide concentration ranges in strata that are likely subject to nonlinear sorption.},

@article{Dong2012,
abstract = {The mobility of an acidic uranium waste plume in the F-Area of Savannah River Site is of great concern. In order to understand and predict uranium mobility, U(VI) adsorption experiments were performed as a function of pH using background F-Area aquifer sediments and reference goethite and kaolinite (major reactive phases of F-Area sediments), and a component-additivity (CA) based surface complexation model (SCM) was developed. Our experimental results indicate that the fine fractions (≤45 $\mu$m) in sediments control U(VI) adsorption due to their large surface area, although the quartz sands show a stronger adsorption ability per unit surface area than the fine fractions at pH < 5.0. Kaolinite is a more important sorbent for U(VI) at pH < 4.0, while goethite plays a major role at pH > 4.0. Our CA model combines an existing U(VI) SCM for goethite and a modified U(VI) SCM for kaolinite along with estimated relative surface area abundances of these component minerals. The modeling approach successfully predicts U(VI) adsorption behavior by the background F-Area sediments. The model suggests that exchange sites on kaolinite dominate U(VI) adsorption at pH < 4.0, goethite and kaolinite edge sites cocontribute to U(VI) adsorption at pH 4.0-6.0, and goethite dominates U(VI) adsorption at pH > 6.0.},

@article{Broholm2005,
abstract = {A chlorinated solvent mixture (2.0 L of trichloroethylene, 0.5 L of chloroform, and 2.5 L of tetrachloroethylene) was released into a sandy aquifer to create a heterogeneously distributed DNAPL (dense nonaqueous-phase liquid) source. The dissolution and dissolved-phase plume development from this source were studied in detail along a cross-section downgradient of the source for a period of approximately 1 year. At the conclusion of the experiment, the site was excavated to map the actual distribution of solvent residuals in the subsurface. Multiple-component dissolution theory provides a tool for the estimation of the mass of a multiple-component DNAPL source present in the groundwater. Concentration ratios between the compounds change with time, and those changes can be used to estimate the mass of DNAPL upgradient of the monitoring point(s) or well(s). The method is independent of the dilution occurring in the groundwater and only requires observations of time series of the contaminants in one or more monitoring points. For the field experiment, the method was applied using the measured concentrations of individual sampling points, the depth-integrated concentrations, the area-integrated concentrations, and the effluent concentrations of the cell. The experiment showed that multiple-component dissolution theory may be a valuable tool for the estimation of the mass of multiple-component DNAPL residuals in the saturated zone.},

abstract = {In order to measure groundwater age and design nuclear waste disposal sites, it is important to understand the sorption behavior of tritium on soils. In this study, batch tests were carried out using four soils from China: silty clays from An County and Jiangyou County in Sichuan Province, both of which could be considered candidate sites for Very Low Level Waste disposal; silty sand from Beijing; and loess from Yuci County in Shanxi Province, a typical Chinese loess region. The experimental results indicated that in these soil media, the distribution coefficient of tritium is slightly influenced by adsorption time, water/solid ratio, initial tritium specific activity, pH, and the content of humic and fulvic acids. The average distribution coefficient from all of these influencing factors was about 0.1-0.2 mL/g for the four types of soil samples. This relatively modest sorption of tritium in soils needs to be considered in fate and transport studies of tritium in the environment.},

abstract = {Assembly of plant Shaker subunits as heterotetramers, increasing channel functional diversity, has been reported. Here we focus on a new interaction, between AKT2 and KAT2 subunits. The assembly as AKT2/KAT2 heterotetramers is demonstrated by (i) a strong signal in two-hybrid tests with intracytoplasmic C-terminal regions, (ii) the effect of KAT2 on AKT2 subunit targeting in tobacco cells, (iii) the complete inhibition of AKT2 currents by co-expression with a dominant-negative KAT2 subunit in Xenopus oocytes, and reciprocally, and (iv) the appearance, upon co-expression of wild-type AKT2 and KAT2 subunits, of new channel functional properties that cannot be explained by the co-existence of two kinds of homotetrameric channels. In particular, the instantaneous current, characteristic of AKT2, displayed new functional features when compared with those of AKT2 homotetramers: activation by external acidification (instead of inhibition) and weak inhibition by calcium. Single channel current measurements in oocytes co-expressing AKT2 and KAT2 revealed a strong preference for incorporation of subunits into heteromultimers and a diversity of individual channels. In planta, these new channels, which may undergo specific regulations, are likely to be formed in guard cells and in the phloem, where they could participate in the control of membrane potential and potassium fluxes.},

abstract = {Perchlorate is known to be a minor component of the hyperarid Atacama Desert salts, and its origin has long been a subject of speculation. Here we report the first measurement of the triple-oxygen isotope ratios (18O/16O and 17O/16O) for both man-made perchlorate from commercial sources and natural perchlorate extracted from Atacama soils. We found that the delta 18O values (i.e., normalized 18O/ 16O ratios) of man-made perchlorate were at -18.4+/-1.2\%, whereas natural perchlorate has a variable delta 18O value, ranging from -4.5\% to -24.8\%. The delta 18O and delta 17O values followed the bulk Earth's oxygen isotope fractionation line for man-made perchlorate, but all Atacama perchlorates deviated from this line, with a distinctly large and positive 170 anomaly ranging from +4.2\% to +9.6\%. These findings provide a tool for the identification and forensics of perchlorate contamination in the environment. Additionally, they confirm an early speculation that the oxidation of volatile chlorine by 03 and the formation of HClO4 can be a sink (albeit a minor one) for atmospheric chlorine.},

Levels of 137Cs in vegetation generally followed the order mosses > lichen > vascular plants. The uptake of 137Cs in vascular plants showed an inverse relationship with the uptake of 40K, with 137Cs TF and Tag values generally higher than 40K TF and Tag values. 40K activity concentrations in all vegetation showed little correlation to associated soil concentrations, while the uptake of 238U, 226Ra and 232Th by vascular and non-vascular plants was generally low.},

abstract = {We study the asymptotics of the \$p\$-mapping model of random mappings on \$[n]\$ as \$n\$ gets large, under a large class of asymptotic regimes for the underlying distribution \$p\$. We encode these random mappings in random walks which are shown to converge to a functional of the exploration process of inhomogeneous random trees, this exploration process being derived (Aldous-Miermont-Pitman 2003) from a bridge with exchangeable increments. Our setting generalizes previous results by allowing a finite number of ``attracting points'' to emerge.},

abstract = {Contamination of groundwater by gasoline and other petroleum-derived hydrocarbons released from underground storage tanks (USTs) is a serious and widespread environmental problem. Natural attenuation is a passive remedial approach that depends upon natural processes to degrade and dissipate contaminants in soil and groundwater. Currently, in situ column technique, microcosm, and computer modeling have been applied for the natural attenuation rate calculation. However, the subsurface heterogeneity reduces the applicability of these techniques. In this study, a mass flux approach was used to calculate the contaminant mass reduction and field-scale decay rate at a gasoline spill site. The mass flux technique is a simplified mass balance procedure, which is accomplished using the differences in total contaminant mass flux across two cross-sections of the contaminant plume. The mass flux calculation shows that up to 87\% of the dissolved total benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) isomers removal was observed via natural attenuation at this site. The efficiency of natural biodegradation was evaluated by the in situ tracer method, and the first-order decay model was applied for the natural attenuation/biodegradation rate calculation. Results reveal that natural biodegradation was the major cause of the BTEX mass reduction among the natural attenuation processes, and approximately 88\% of the BTEX removal was due to the natural biodegradation process. The calculated total BTEX first-order attenuation and biodegradation rates were 0.036 and 0.025\% per day, respectively. Results suggest that the natural attenuation mechanisms can effectively contain the plume, and the mass flux method is useful in assessing the occurrence and efficiency of the natural attenuation process.},

abstract = {What is model selection? What are the goals of model selection? What are the methods of model selection and how do they work? Which methods perform better than others and in what circumstances? These questions rest on a number of key concepts in a relatively underdeveloped field. The aim of this paper is to explain some background concepts, to highlight some of the results in this special issue, and to add my own. The standard methods of model selection include classical hypothesis testing, maximum likelihood, Bayes method, minimum description length, cross-validation, and Akaike's information criterion. They all provide an implementation of Occam's razor, in which parsimony or simplicity is balanced against goodness-of-fit. These methods primarily take account of the sampling errors in parameter estimation, although their relative success at this task depends on the circumstances. However, the aim of model selection should also include the ability of a model to generalize to predictions in a different domain. Errors of extrapolation, or generalization, are different from errors of parameter estimation. So, it seems that simplicity and parsimony may be an additional factor in managing these errors, in which case the standard methods of model selection are incomplete implementations of Occam's razor.

abstract = {The Virtual Aquifer approach is used in this study to assess the uncertainty involved in the estimation of contaminant plume lengths in heterogeneous aquifers. Contaminant plumes in heterogeneous two-dimensional conductivity fields and subject to first order and Michaelis-Menten (MM) degradation kinetics are investigated by the center line method. First order degradation rates and plume lengths are estimated from point information obtained along the plume center line. Results from a Monte-Carlo investigation show that the estimated rate constant is highly uncertain and biased towards overly high values. Uncertainty and bias amplify with increasing heterogeneity up to maximum values of one order of magnitude. Calculated plume lengths reflect this uncertainty and bias. On average, plume lengths are estimated to about 50\% of the true plume length. When plumes subject to MM degradation kinetics are investigated by using a first order rate law, an additional error is introduced and uncertainty as well as bias increase, causing plume length estimates to be less than 40\% of the true length. For plumes with MM degradation kinetics, therefore, a regression approach is used which allows the determination of the MM parameters from center line data. Rate parameters are overestimated by a factor of two on average, while plume length estimates are about 80\% of the true length. Plume lengths calculated using the MM parameters are thus closer to the correct length, as compared to the first order approximation. This approach is therefore recommended if field data collected along the center line of a plume give evidence of MM kinetics.},

abstract = {The conditional variance function in a heteroscedastic, nonparametric regression model is estimated by linear smoothing of squared residuals. Attention is focused on local polynomial smoothers. Both the mean and variance functions are assumed to be smooth, but neither is assumed to be in a parametric family. The biasing effect of preliminary estimation of the mean is studied, and a degrees-of-freedom correction of bias is proposed. The corrected method is shown to be adaptive in the sense that the variance function can be estimated with the same asymptotic mean and variance as if the mean function were known. A proposal is made for using standard bandwidth selectors for estimating both the mean and variance functions. The proposal is illustrated with data from the LIDAR method of measuring atmospheric pollutants and from turbulence-model computations.},

This model is based on the introduction of fractal theory, and more particularly of the concept of self-similarity, into a statistical physics rationale. Fractal theory provides the necessary tools to describe the complexity of tree structure. Statistics, when applied to physics, makes it possible to explain the properties of complex objects starting from their components. The combination of both tools allowed us to develop a theoretical model that is the probability density function of the morphometric lengths of trees. An example of validation of this law is given here: the theoretical model of morphometric lengths is compared with experimental data of Cupressocyparis.},

abstract = {In this paper, multiresolution analysis using wavelets is discussed and evaluated in ECG signal processing. The approach we developed for processing the ECG signals uses two steps. In the first step, we implement an algorithm based on multiresolution analysis using discrete wavelet transform for denoising the ECG signals. The results we obtained on MIT-BIH ECG signals show good performance in denoising ECG signals. In the second step, multiresolution analysis is applied for QRS complex detection. It is shown that with such analysis, the QRS complex can be distinguished from high P or T waves, baseline drift and artefacts. The results we obtained on ECG signals from the MIT-BIH database show a detection rate of QRS complexes above 99.8\% (sensitivity=99.88\% and predictivity=99.89\%), and a total detection failure of 0.24\%.},

@article{Schwehr2009,
abstract = {One of the key risk drivers at radioactive waste disposal facilities is radioiodine, especially 129I. As iodine mobility varies greatly with iodine speciation, experiments with 129I-contaminated aquifer sediments from the Savannah River Site located in Aiken, SC, were carried out to test iodine interactions with soils and aquifer sediments. Using tracer 125I- and stable 127I- additions, it was shown that such interactions were highly dependent on I- concentrations added to sediment suspensions, contact time with the sediment, and organic carbon (OC) content, resulting in an empirical particle-water partition coefficient (Kd) that was an inverse power function of the added I- concentration. However, Kd values of organically bound 127I were 3 orders of magnitude higher than those determined after 1-2 weeks of tracer equilibration, approaching those of OC. Under ambient conditions, organo-iodine (OI) was a major fraction (67\%) of the total iodine in the dissolved phase and by implication of the particulate phase. As the total concentration of amended I- increased, the fraction of detectable dissolved OI decreased. This trend, attributed to OC becoming the limiting factor in the aquifer sediment explains why at elevated I-concentrations OI is often not detected.},

abstract = {Understanding the fate of contaminant in wetland flows is essential in applications such as ecological risk assessment and environmental hydraulic design. Presented in this paper is an analytical study on the dispersion of contaminant in a two-zone wetland, with the effect of ecological degradation taken into consideration. Environmental dispersion is discussed separately via an exponential transformation for the general formulation of contaminant transport. Taylor’s classical analysis for solute dispersion in a long and thin tube flow is rigorously generalized for the dispersion of the lateral mean contaminant concentration in the longitudinal direction. A method of asymptotic analysis is adopted instead of the concentration moment method in order to simplify the process of deduction and the expression of the analytical solution. Gill’s method of mean concentration expansion is applied to model the concentration deviation terms produced in an averaging operation. With the velocity profile obtained previously, the enhancement of the environmental dispersivity under long time evolution is determined and shown to be consistent with that obtained by the method of concentration moment. Analytical solutions for the evolution of the contaminant concentration and the influenced region of the contaminant cloud are obtained by combining both the hydraulic and the ecological effects. For typical pollutant as the heavy metal Hg, the evolution of contaminant cloud is illustrated by critical length and duration in an application with concentration beyond some given environmental standard level. Results show that for wetland flows with a two-zone structure, the influenced region is reduced evidently while the duration of the contaminant cloud remains nearly unchanged, compared with that for the single-zone wetland flow.},

abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of regulations and issues relating to the generation, storage, treatment, and disposal of regulated medical waste (RMW), generally referred to as healthcare waste (HCW) in the United States, the United Kingdom, in Europe, and elsewhere. It illustrates a comprehensive definition of what is generally considered to be RMW/HCW, to provide a brief history of the catalysts that prompted an international regulatory response to the potential hazards associated with this waste stream, and to discuss the development of regulations and rules relating to RMW/HCW. Currently established frameworks and standards relating to the characterization, packaging, treatment, and disposal of RMW/HCW from an international perspective demonstrate a range of disparities according to the cited literature, and they are generally dependent on several factors—existing socioeconomic issues and government provisions, the level and quality of education and resources provided to the public, the provision and use of appropriate treatment technologies for viable and effective disposition of this waste stream, and regulatory initiatives and enforcement provisions available to curtail the inappropriate handling, treatment, and disposal of items within this waste stream. Many industrialized nations have developed regulations that adequately and effectively provide safe and environmentally viable means for the treatment and disposal of RMW/HCW, but financial and regulatory burdens remain significant obstacles for nations lacking necessary resources.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of estimating a likelihood map for the location of the source of a chemical plume using an autonomous vehicle as a sensor probe in a fluid flow. The fluid flow is assumed to have a high Reynolds number. Therefore, the dispersion of the chemical is dominated by turbulence, resulting in an intermittent chemical signal. The vehicle is capable of detecting above-threshold chemical concentration and sensing the fluid flow velocity at the vehicle location. This paper reviews instances of biological plume tracing and reviews previous strategies for a vehicle-based plume tracing. The main contribution is a new source-likelihood mapping approach based on Bayesian inference methods. Using this Bayesian methodology, the source-likelihood map is propagated through time and updated in response to both detection and nondetection events. Examples are included that use data from in-water testing to compare the mapping approach derived herein with the map derived using a previously existing technique.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on parameters describing the distribution of dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) contaminants and investigates the variability of these parameters that results from soil heterogeneity. In addition, it quantifies the uncertainty reduction that can be achieved with increased density of soil sampling. Numerical simulations of DNAPL releases were performed using stochastic realizations of hydraulic conductivity fields generated with the same geostatistical parameters and conditioning data at two sampling densities, thus generating two simulation ensembles of low and high density (three-fold increase) of soil sampling. The results showed that DNAPL plumes in aquifers identical in a statistical sense exhibit qualitatively different patterns, ranging from compact to finger-like. The corresponding quantitative differences were expressed by defining several alternative measures that describe the DNAPL plume and computing these measures for each simulation of the two ensembles. The uncertainty in the plume features under study was affected to different degrees by the variability of the soil, with coefficients of variation ranging from about 20\% to 90\%, for the low-density sampling. Meanwhile, the increased soil sampling frequency resulted in reductions of uncertainty varying from 7\% to 69\%, for low- and high-uncertainty variables, respectively. In view of the varying uncertainty in the characteristics of a DNAPL plume, remedial designs that require estimates of the less uncertain features of the plume may be preferred over others that need a more detailed characterization of the source zone architecture.},

@article{Bloschl1995,
abstract = {A framework is provided for scaling and scale issues in hydrology. The first section gives some basic definitions. This is important as researchers do not seem to have agreed on the meaning of concepts such as scale or upscaling. ‘Process scale’, ‘observation scale’ and ‘modelling (working) scale’ require different definitions. The second section discusses heterogeneity and variability in catchments and touches on the implications of randomness and organization for scaling. The third section addresses the linkages across scales from a modelling point of view. It is argued that up- scaling typically consists of two steps: distributing and aggregating. Conversely, downscaling involves disaggregation and singling out. Different approaches are discussed for linking state variables, parameters, inputs and conceptual- izations across scales. This section also deals with distributed parameter models, which are one way of linking con- ceptualizations across scales. The fourth section addresses the linkages across scales from a more holistic perspective dealing with dimensional analysis and similarity concepts. The main difference to the modelling point of view is that dimensional analysis and similarity concepts deal with complex processes in a much simpler fashion. Examples of dimensional analysis, similarity analysis and functional normalization in catchment hydrology are given. This section also briefly discusses fractals, which are a popular tool for quantifying variability across scales. The fifth section focuses on one particular aspect of this holistic view, discussing stream network analysis. The paper concludes with identifying key issues and gives some directions for future research.},

abstract = {Mine wastes and their environmentally acceptable storage constitute the largest waste problem on the planet. Mine wastes have been accumulating for thousands of years, and their rate of production has accelerated in step with increases of the human population to an estimated world-wide production rate of 350 × 109ta-1. If collected and spread in a uniform thickness, the waste could cover the 84 000 km2 area of Ireland to a depth of more than 2 metres.
The types and characteristics of mine wastes and the ways in which they are stored are described. Mine waste storages are dangerous structures in terms of associated accidental deaths and continuing environmental hazards. Situations leading to failure, types of failures and methods of preventing their occurrence and minimizing environmental damage are described with illustrative examples.
Mining activities produce larger quantities of waste and have more adverse environmental impacts than waste from any other human activity. This chapter outlines the subject of mine waste storage. Mine waste can be divided into coarse grained wastes that are usually stored in surface dumps, and fine-grained wastes, usually stored in hydraulic-fill structures. Both coarse and fine mine wastes could contain toxic substances, emit radioactive radon gas, or be combustible. Therefore, mine waste storages need to be constructed and protected in such a way that their adverse effects on human health and the natural environment are minimized on a long-term, continuing basis. Fortunately, controls and statutory regulations for the storage of mine waste are being tightened in most countries, and at the same time, the engineering skills needed to construct and maintain storages safely and for long periods of time are also improving. It is very important to realize that once amine waste storage has been created, it constitutes a hazard that requires ongoing maintenance and care for millennia to come.},

@incollection{Shulman2011a,
abstract = {Tyres are an essential part of the economy of every country that relies on vehicular and air transport to move people and goods. The management of post-consumer tyres is greatly influenced by environmental legislation at International, European Union (EU), and State levels. Each has had an important impact on recycling—and recyclers—from sourcing raw materials, to product development and marketing, and the disposal of recycling residues. The starting point for tyre recycling is the same as other industries—the sourcing of a continuous flow of raw materials. Historically, post-consumer tyres have been collected separately and sorted into two sectors—the part worn market (second-hand) and retreading. However, as retreading dwindled, reuse/export stagnated, material recycling and energy recovery operations began to absorb the tyres. In many countries with large retreading industries, the infrastructure for collecting, sorting and transporting tyres became the means of servicing. Generally, prior to delivery to a treatment facility, the tyres are sorted by category, including car, truck and others, and then by size. Tyre recycling treatments range from the simplest mechanical cutting devices to sophisticated, complex multi-phase chemical, mechanochemical and thermal processes, which overcome many of the principal obstacles inherent in the recycling of thermoset rubbers.},

abstract = {The classical filtering and prediction problem is re-examined using the Bode- Shannon representation of random processes and the state transition method of analysis of dynamic systems. New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modifica- tion to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite- memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co- efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are ob- tained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

abstract = {In this study, the factors that influence the variability of soil to plant radionuclide transfer factors (TF) in tropical and subtropical environments were statistically analyzed. More than 2,700 TF values were obtained from the literature, and from this four broad soil groups and 13 plant groups were investigated. Additionally, different plant compartments were distinguished. The wide variability and uncertainty observed in TF is considerably reduced when data are independently grouped into groups of plant/plant part/soil type combinations. In most plant groups Zn and Sr have the highest transfer values. TFs are lower for Cs and the lowest TFs were found for Ra, U and Pb.},

@book{Snow1855,
abstract = {Snow expanded his reports on his cholera research in a book entitled On the Mode of Communication of Cholera published in London the same year. That book contained more statistical data confirming his theories. Over the next five years Snow continued his research, publishing a second edition of the book in 1855. This was so greatly revised and expanded that it was essentially a new work. In it Snow set forth his views of the etiology and spread of cholera, which he believed to be caused by a living organism (a belief confirmed by Koch's discovery of the cholera vibrio in 1883), and included statistical surveys made during the great cholera epidemic of 1854, demonstrating that the number of cholera deaths in each area of southern London corresponded to the degree of contamination of the local drinking water. This 1855 edition was the first to tell the dramatic story of the Broad Street pump, which, after contamination with sewage from a nearby pipe, caused 500 cholera deaths within the space of ten days. Once the epidemic had peaked, Snow persuaded the parish councilors to remove the pump handle, and the number of cholera attacks decreased rapidly. Snow's report of the Broad Street epidemic included a spot-map of the district showing the location of each pump and fatal cholera cases-- the first use of a spot-map in epidemiology.--J. Norman, 2006.},

Good fits can be misleading because they can result from properties of the model that have nothing to do with it being a close approximation to the cognitive process of interest (e.g. overfitting). Selection methods are introduced that factor in these properties when measuring fit. Their success in outperforming standard goodness-of-fit measures stems from a focus on measuring the generalizability of a model's data-fitting abilities, which should be the goal of model selection.},

abstract = {Neurobehavioural tests were undertaken by 30 female workers exposed to toluene and matched controls with low occupational exposure to toluene. The environmental air levels (TWA) of toluene was 88 ppm for the exposed workers and 13 ppm for the controls. The toluene in blood concentrations for the exposed workers was 1.25 mg/l and for the controls 0.16 mg/l. Statistically significant differences between workers exposed to toluene and controls in neurobehavioural tests measuring manual dexterity (grooved peg board), visual scanning (trail making, visual reproduction, Benton visual retention, and digit symbol), and verbal memory (digit span) were observed. Further, the performance at each of these tests was related to time weighted average exposure concentrations of air toluene. The workers exposed to toluene had no clinical symptoms or signs. The question arises as to whether these impairments in neurobehavioural tests are reversible or whether they could be a forerunner of more severe damage.},

abstract = {A methodology using a nonlinear optimization model is presentedfor estimating unknown magnitude, location and duration ofgroundwater pollution sources under transient flow and transportconditions. The proposed optimization model incorporates thegoverning equations of flow and solute transport as binding equalityconstraints, and thus essentially simulates the physical processes oftransient flow and transient transport in the groundwater systems.The proposed inverse model identifies unknown sources of pollution byusing measured values of pollutant concentration at selectedlocations. Performance of the proposed model for the identificationof unknown groundwater pollution sources is evaluated for anillustrative study area in a hypothetical confined aquifer underdifferent cases of data availability. The effect of observation welllocation vis-\`{a}-vis pollution source location on identificationaccuracy is also investigated. Performance of the developedidentification model is also evaluated for a condition whenconcentration measurements are missing during few initial timeperiods after the pollution sources become active. The effect ofspecified initial guesses of the variable values on the optimalsolutions are also investigated. These performance evaluation resultsdemonstrate the limitations and potential applicability of theproposed optimization model for identifying the sources of pollutionin transient groundwater systems.},

abstract = {A method for fitting regression models to data that exhibit spatial correlation and heteroskedasticity is proposed. It is well known that ignoring a nonconstant variance does not bias least-squares estimates of regression parameters; thus, data analysts are easily lead to the false belief that moderate heteroskedasticity can generally be ignored. Unfortunately, ignoring nonconstant variance when fitting variograms can seriously bias estimated correlation functions. By modeling heteroskedasticity and standardizing by estimated standard deviations, our approach eliminates this bias in the correlations. A combination of parametric and nonparametric regression techniques is used to iteratively estimate the various components of the model. The approach is demonstrated on a large data set of predicted nitrogen runoff from agricultural lands in the Midwest and Northern Plains regions of the U.S.A. For this data set, the model comprises three main components: (1) the mean function, which includes farming practice variables, local soil and climate characteristics, and the nitrogen application treatment, is assumed to be linear in the parameters and is fitted by generalized least squares; (2) the variance function, which contains a local and a spatial component whose shapes are left unspecified, is estimated by local linear regression; and (3) the spatial correlation function is estimated by fitting a parametric variogram model to the standardized residuals, with the standardization adjusting the variogram for the presence of heteroskedasticity. The fitting of these three components is iterated until convergence. The model provides an improved fit to the data compared with a previous model that ignored the heteroskedasticity and the spatial correlation.},

@incollection{Genaidy2011,
abstract = {In today's global economy, the practice of sustainable development is of particular importance to the handling of toxic materials such as lead to encourage industrial organizations and its stakeholders to take an active role in maximizing human and environmental health. Currently, there is limited information on recycling rates for lead-acid batteries (LAB) in the published literature. By the late 1900s, the use of lead was significantly reduced or eliminated in non-battery products in most of the developed and developing countries, including gasoline, paints, solders, and water systems. As the use of lead in non-lead battery products has continued to decline, the demand of lead has continued to grow in starting–lighting–ignition (SLI) and non-SLI LAB applications (such as, motive sources of power for industrial forklifts, mining equipment, airport ground equipment, uninterruptible power systems in telecommunication networks). In the early 2000s, the total demand for lead in all types of lead-acid storage batteries represented around 88\% of apparent lead consumption. Three opportunities for lead recovery and recycling include lead in spent batteries with consumers, mishandled batteries sent to auto wreckers, and lead in spent batteries in municipal waste. In light of increased lead prices, it makes economic and environmental sense to maximize lead recovery and recycling by establishing a strong ecologic interface between various stakeholders and consumers.},

The book provides details of the construction and operation of nuclear reactors and associated facilities, as well as their decommissioning and the management of nuclear waste at the site. The contents detail the influence on the site of developments in nuclear science, the Cold War, environmental concerns, and domestic politics. The social and economic effects of the site on its region are also described. Numerous photographs, diagrams, and maps enrich the interesting narrative. The text includes descriptions of reactor technology and chemical separations developed at the site to improve the production of plutonium, heavy water, and tritium for the United States nuclear weapons program. The volume also includes a chronology, biographies of site managers, and an extensive set of endnotes. The book is published by the U.S. Department of Energy and therefore presents a single view of the Savannah River Site story.},

abstract = {In 1960, R.E. Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive solution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers \& results.},

abstract = {There are two broad areas of pollution that pose ongoing negative impacts to the public. These are legacy pollution and ongoing releases. Legacy pollution refers to toxic chemical releases into the environment during a time pre-dating strict environmental enforcement practices. “Standard of Care” is a term of art that is generally defined as the degree of prudence and caution required of an individual who is under a duty of care. Generally, it is thought to concern the degree of caution that a reasonable person should exercise in a given situation so as to avoid causing injury. It is the watchfulness, attention, caution, and prudence that a reasonable person under the same or similar circumstances would exercise. Strict environmental enforcement has made the single most difference in overall improved environmental performance by industry. The fear of fines, penalties, and even imprisonment of owners and operators who violate statutory obligations under pollution control permits have driven industry on the whole to adopt BMPs and to make investments into controls. Finally, good corporate governance includes environmental stewardship as a foundation. From the most general standpoint, Responsible Care means acting in a responsible manner toward public and worker safety, protecting the environment, and respecting the properties and quality of life of others.},

abstract = {Scientists, site managers and regulators participating in environmental remediation activities usually need to access, create, and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data, including disparate site characterization data, and models that range from conceptual to numerical . The data are necessary to enable the development of conceptual and numerical models, parameter estimation, and multiple simulations. We designed a methodology based on DOE Savannah River Site F - Area and Hanford databases that included well layout, concentration, groundwater level, lithology, meteorological records, contaminant levels, etc. The approach was necessary to effectively manage the staging and views of environmental data to ensure that site characterization and monit oring data are readily available as inputs for parameter estimation, numerical predictions, uncertainty quantification, and risk analysis. This paper describes the methodology and the application of the developed data management system to the Savannah Rive r F - Area site observations. In particular, we present methods for organizing different databases and data types into a common framework that allows the user to browse the data as a single coherent dataset. A nalyses of the Savannah River F - area using the da ta management system illustrate the utility of the system . The paper also demonstrates the utility of interfaces designed to leverage and integrate existing large - scale data management, provenance and indexing technologies from the scientific community and discuss the next steps.},

abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of the large number of waste regulations, with a particular emphasis on the regulatory environment in the United States and the United Kingdom. Environmental laws and rules address all types of wastes that find their way to the land, air and water. The regulations not only address waste streams, but the safety of products.
Environmental problems faced today differ from those of most of the Earth's history in both kind and degree. Society and its elected and appointed delegates increasingly respond to waste-related problems by writing and enforcing laws. The number of laws enacted to address various aspects of wastes has grown substantially in recent decades. Waste management requires attention to the waste and the characteristics of the place where the waste is found. This place is known as the “environmental medium.” The major environmental media are air, water, soil, sediment, and even biota. To make the regulation of wastes is even more refined, waste management must be viewed systematically. Wastes tend to be transported and can cause problems well beyond the borders of nations. One of the key waste management challenges of the twenty-first century is the ease at which waste problems are simply transferred to countries with less stringent controls. The interconnections of wastes can lead to a “circle of poisons,” the phenomenon where nations may ban a substance, but it continues to be produced and used in other, usually less economically developed, countries. Despite the ban within the borders of certain countries, the feared substance returns. Thus, the rationale for the ban, that is reduced risks to that country's inhabitants, is forgone and people continue to be exposed when they import the products that contain or are contaminated with the banned substances.},

abstract = {The problem of locating sources in dynamical systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs) is a particular case of the more general class of inverse problems. Source localization problems are often approached using non-model-based techniques. By using a priori knowledge of system dynamics, model-based approaches to this problem can be developed, reducing the number of sensors required to solve the problem. The paper presents three such approaches: off-line numerical computation of the time response data at the sensor(s) from all possible source locations and functions of source strength, spatial and time discretization of the PDE model, and off-line solution of a dual (\&ldquo;forward\&rdquo;) PDE problem based on the adjoint system model.},

@article{Beven2001,
abstract = {It may be endemic to mechanistic modelling of complex environmental systems that there are many different model structures and many different parameter sets within a chosen model structure that may be behavioural or acceptable in reproducing the observed behaviour of that system. This has been called the equifinality concept. The generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology for model identification allowing for equifinality is described. Prediction within this methodology is a process of ensemble forecasting using a sample of parameter sets from the behavioural model space, with each sample weighted according to its likelihood measure to estimate prediction quantiles. This allows that different models may contribute to the ensemble prediction interval at different time steps and that the distributional form of the predictions may change over time. Any effects of model nonlinearity, covariation of parameter values and errors in model structure, input data or observed variables, with which the simulations are compared, are handled implicitly within this procedure. GLUE involves a number of choices that must be made explicit and can be therefore subjected to scrutiny and discussion. These include ways of combining information from different types of model evaluation or from different periods in a data assimilation context. An example application to rainfall-runoff modelling is used to illustrate the methodology, including the updating of likelihood measures.},

In this report the procedure to assess 99Tc and 129I content in liquid samples using liquid-scintillation counting is presented. 99Tc and 129I are adsorbed on AG 1 X2 ion-exchange resin. 129I is then eluted with NaOCl and further purified by liquid-liquid extraction using carbon tetrachloride and an aqueous solution of sodium thiosulphate. 99Tc is eluted with hot nitric acid (6 M/60 degrees C). If necessary any 60Co present in the sample is separated by liquid-liquid extraction of the cobalt-TTA complex with iso-BuOH. The overall recovery yield is 96.5 +/- 2.5\% for 99Tc and 90.1 +/- 6.2\% for 129I. Finally beta-activity is measured by liquid-scintillation counting. A limit of detection of 5 Bq/L can thus be obtained for both 99Tc and 129I.},

abstract = {Acetoclastic methanogenesis in the second stage of a two-phase biogas reactor is investigated. A mathematical model coupling chemical reactions with transport of process liquid and with the variation of population of the microorganisms living on the plastic tower packing of the reactor is proposed. The evolution of the liquid is described by an advection-diffusion-reaction equation, while a monod-type kinetic is used for the reactions. Moreover, a new inhibition factor MO(max) is introduced, which hinders the growth of microorganisms when the plastic tower packing is overpopulated. After estimating the reaction parameters, the acetate outflow measured experimentally is in good agreement with that predicted by simulations. For coupling liquid transport with reaction processes, a spatial discretization of the reactor is performed. This yields essential information about the distribution of acetate and the production of methane in the reactor. This information allows for defining a measure of the effectiveness of the reactor.},

abstract = {This paper explores the similarities of digital elevation maps (DEMs) of natural river basins and optimal channel network (OCN) configurations obtained minimizing the total rate of energy expenditure in the system as a whole and in its parts. Striking similarities are observed for natural and optimal networks in their fractal aggregation structure and in certain multifractal structures found to be characteristic of river basins. Our results suggest, upon critical assessment of the reliability of the identification of the attractor of the underlying dynamics implied by our optimality concepts, that fractal structures are indeed possibly a product of least energy dissipation. Power laws emerging in the description of the distribution of aggregated quantities from both DEMs and OCNs suggest a link with the framework of self-organized criticality in the dynamics of natural channel network formation. Also, the geomorphological description of OCNs reveals surprising analogies with well-known empirical or experimental results, A comparison of Peano's basins with OCNs suggests that nature seems to reject the type of strict self-similarity exhibited by Peano's construct in favor of different shapes implying statistical self-similarity not only because of chance acting through random conditions but also because of necessity as reflected by least energy expenditure considerations.},

@article{Conant2004,
abstract = {An investigation of a tetrachloroethene (PCE) groundwater plume originating at a dry cleaning facility on a sand aquifer and discharging to a river showed that the near-river zone strongly modified the distribution, concentration, and composition of the plume prior to discharging into the surface water. The plume, streambed concentration, and hydrogeology were extensively characterized using the Waterloo profiler, mini-profiler, conventional and driveable multilevel samplers (MLS), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys, streambed temperature mapping (to identify discharge zones), drivepoint piezometers, and soil coring and testing. The plume observed in the shallow streambed deposits was significantly different from what would have been predicted based on the characteristics of the upgradient plume. Spatial and temporal variations in the plume entering the near-river zone contributed to the complex contaminant distribution observed in the streambed where concentrations varied by factors of 100 to 5000 over lateral distances of less than 1 to 3.5 m. Low hydraulic conductivity semi-confining deposits and geological heterogeneities at depth below the streambed controlled the pattern of groundwater discharge through the streambed and influenced where the plume discharged into the river (even causing the plume to spread out over the full width of the streambed at some locations). The most important effect of the near-river zone on the plume was the extensive anaerobic biodegradation that occurred in the top 2.5 m of the streambed, even though essentially no biodegradation of the PCE plume was observed in the upgradient aquifer. Approximately 54\% of the area of the plume in the streambed consisted solely of PCE transformation products, primarily cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride (VC). High concentrations in the interstitial water of the streambed did not correspond to high groundwater-discharge zones, but instead occurred in low discharge zones and are likely sorbed or retarded remnants of past high-concentration plume discharges. The high-concentration areas (up to 5529 microg/l of total volatile organics) in the streambed are of ecological concern and represent potential adverse exposure locations for benthic and hyporheic zone aquatic life, but the effect of these exposures on the overall health of the river has yet to be determined. Even if the upgradient source of PCE is remediated and additional PCE is prevented from reaching the streambed, the high-concentration deposits in the streambed will likely take decades to hundreds of years to flush completely clean under natural conditions because these areas have low vertical groundwater flow velocities and high retardation factors. Despite high concentrations of contaminants in the streambed, PCE was detected in the surface water only rarely due to rapid dilution in the river and no cDCE or VC was detected. Neither the sampling of surface water nor the sampling of the groundwater from the aquifer immediately adjacent to the river gave an accurate indication of the high concentrations of PCE biodegradation products present in the streambed. Sampling of the interstitial water of the shallow streambed deposits is necessary to accurately characterize the nature of plumes discharging to rivers.},

@article{PatrickWang2005,
abstract = {While the discussion of model uncertainty has centered on spatial heterogeneity, it is possible that ground water models have not enjoyed much success as predictive tools often because the sources that were eventually imposed in the field differed from those represented in the simulations. This is because deterministic prediction of future conditions is often inaccurate due to the random nature of contaminant sources, in terms of their timing, location, and magnitude. This paper presents a stochastic framework for accommodating random contaminant sources in conventional, deterministic advection-dispersion transport models. The contaminant sources are first classified into two types: those occurring continuously with a deterministic component and random variations and those occurring randomly at instantaneous discrete-time intervals. For the first type, the governing partial differential equation (PDE) is replaced by a stochastic PDE. The random variations are modeled by Gaussian noise or Brownian motion, and the solution is obtained by using Ito's integration technique. For the second type, Markovian analysis is used for discrete-time contamination events. Both approaches use a deterministic transport model to generate response functions at any observation location and time. The response functions are then integrated to yield probabilistic description of contaminant transport, from which key statistical properties such as mean, standard deviation, and confidence interval can be drawn.},

abstract = {Radionuclide concentrations were measured in soil and vegetation growing adjacent to and in the Savannah River Laboratory Seepage Basins as part of the plan for closure of the basin system. The results of the measurements provide some information about the mobility of the radionuclides introduced into the basins. \{sup 90\}Sr is the most mobile of the radionuclides in soil. Its high mobility and high relative uptake by vegetation cause \{sup 90\}Sr to be distributed throughout the basin system. \{sup 137\}Cs is not as mobile in the basin soil, limiting its uptake by vegetation growing on the edge of the seepage basins; however, it is readily taken up by the vegetation growing in the basins. Soil mobility and vegetation uptake is relatively low for all of the transuranic radionuclides. For the most part these radionuclides remain near the surface of the basin soils where they were absorbed from the waste-water. The relative role of soil mobility and vegetation uptake on the distribution of radionuclide at the basins was futher evaluated by comparing the vegetation concentration ratio and the half-depth of penetration of the radionuclides in the basin soil. The results suggest that vegetation processes dominate in determining the concentration of \{sup 60\}Co and \{sup 137\}Cs in the vegetation. The influences of soil and vegetation are more balanced for \{sup 90\}Sr. The other radionuclides exhibit both low soil mobility and low vegetation uptake. The lack of soil mobility is seen in the lower concentrations found in vegetation growing on the edge of the basin compared to those growing in the basin.},

Uranium soil-to-plant transfer factors (TF) ranged from 0.0003 to 0.0340kgkg(-1). There was no significant relation between the U soil-to-plant transfer (or total U uptake or flux) and the uranium concentration in the soil solution or any other soil factor measured, nor with the U recovered following selective soil extractions. Multiple linear regression analysis resulted in a significant though complex model explaining up to 99\% of variation in TF. The influence of uranium speciation on uranium uptake observed was featured: UO(2)(+2), uranyl carbonate complexes and UO(2)PO(4)(-) seem the U species being preferentially taken up by the roots and transferred to the shoots. Improved correlations were obtained when relating the uranium TF with the summed soil solution concentrations of mentioned uranium species.},

abstract = {At the request of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the National Research Council (NRC) recently completed a major report, Science and Decisions: Advancing Risk Assessment, that is intended to strengthen the scientific basis, credibility, and effectiveness of risk assessment practices and subsequent risk management decisions. The report describes the challenges faced by risk assessment and the need to consider improvements in both the technical analyses of risk assessments (i.e., the development and use of scientific information to improve risk characterization) and the utility of risk assessments (i.e., making assessments more relevant and useful for risk management decisions). The report tackles a number of topics relating to improvements in the process, including the design and framing of risk assessments, uncertainty and variability characterization, selection and use of defaults, unification of cancer and noncancer dose-response assessment, cumulative risk assessment, and the need to increase EPA's capacity to address these improvements. This article describes and summarizes the NRC report, with an eye toward its implications for risk assessment practices at EPA.},

@article{Beinhorn2005,
abstract = {In this paper we present numerical simulations carried out to assess the importance of density-dependent flow on tracer plume development. The scenario considered in the study is characterized by a short-term tracer injection phase into a fully penetrating well and a natural hydraulic gradient. The scenario is thought to be typical for tracer tests conducted in the field. Using a reference case as a starting point, different model parameters were changed in order to determine their importance to density effects. The study is based on a three-dimensional model domain. Results were interpreted using concentration contours and a first moment analysis. Tracer injections of 0.036 kg per meter of saturated aquifer thickness do not cause significant density effects assuming hydraulic gradients of at least 0.1\%. Higher tracer input masses, as used for geoelectrical investigations, may lead to buoyancy-induced flow in the early phase of a tracer test which in turn impacts further plume development. This also holds true for shallow aquifers. Results of simulations with different tracer injection rates and durations imply that the tracer input scenario has a negligible effect on density flow. Employing model cases with different realizations of a log conductivity random field, it could be shown that small variations of hydraulic conductivity in the vicinity of the tracer injection well have a major control on the local tracer distribution but do not mask effects of buoyancy-induced flow.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of the current status of radioecology and how it might be applied to contribute to a broader range of environmental pollution and contamination problems. In many respects radioecology is a unique and specialised branch of environmental science. However, radioecologists could be much more aware of the similarities and differences between their field and other fields of environmental pollution science. Areas of common interest described herein are exposure and risk assessment, and the problem of the bioavailability of potentially toxic substances in environmental media. It is concluded that radiometric methods and radioecological modelling methods can assist significantly with understanding and quantifying both these issues. The existence of multiple contaminants at many locations around the world dictates that assessment and remediation exercises should be carried out in an integrated fashion, as a partnership between scientific disciplines.},

abstract = {Studies of radionuclides in the environment have entered a new era with the renaissance of nuclear energy and associated fuel reprocessing, geological disposal of high-level nuclear wastes, and concerns about national security with respect to nuclear non-proliferation. This work presents an overview on sources of anthropogenic radionuclides in the environment, as well as a brief discussion of salient geochemical behavior of important radionuclides. We first discuss the following major anthropogenic sources and current developments that have lead, or could potentially contribute, to the radionuclide contamination of the environment: (1) nuclear weapons program; (2) nuclear weapons testing; (3) nuclear power plants; (4) uranium mining and milling; (5) commercial fuel reprocessing; (6) geological repository of high-level nuclear wastes that include radionuclides might be released in the future, and (7) nuclear accidents. Then, we briefly summarize the inventory of radionuclides (99)Tc and (129)I, as well as geochemical behavior for radionuclides (99)Tc, (129)I, and (237)Np, because of their complex geochemical behavior, long half-lives, and presumably high mobility in the environment; biogeochemical cycling and environment risk assessment must take into account speciation of these redox-sensitive radionuclides.},

abstract = {A 6-month soil column experiment was conducted to compare the upward migration and plant uptake of radiochlorine and radioiodine from shallow, near-surface contaminated water tables. Both fixed and fluctuating water tables were studied. After 6 months, (36)Cl activity concentrations were relatively uniform throughout the soil profile apart from an accumulation at the soil surface, which was especially marked under a fluctuating water table scenario. In contrast, (125)I (a surrogate for (129)I) tended to accumulate at the boundary between the anoxic conditions at the base of the column and the oxic conditions above, due to its redox-dependent sorption behaviour. The uptake of (36)Cl by perennial ryegrass was much greater than that of (125)I due to its greater migration into the rooting zone and its ready availability in soil solution. In the context of radioactive waste disposal, where these radionuclides may potentially be released into groundwater, (36)Cl would be expected to present a greater potential for contamination of the biosphere than (129)I.},

abstract = {Since the advent of the modern nuclear age in the 1940’s, man has effectively managed the often hazardous waste produced by nuclear processes. Expansion of nuclear energy worldwide is likely to meet increased power demands and greenhouse gas reduction targets and will result in increased radioactive waste generation. Managing this waste effectively is a critical component of a world-wide “nuclear renaissance.” Past practice has proven the wastes generated from nuclear power generation can be effectively managed using technologies that are well demonstrated at industrial scales, with decades of safe operating practices. Emphasis is necessary to ensure that future nuclear fuel cycles remain economically and environmentally competitive (as compared to other forms of energy production) and do not produce legacy waste management issues for future generations. This chapter discusses the history of nuclear waste management and provides the current “state-of-the-art” for management of all forms of nuclear waste.
Expansion of nuclear energy worldwide is necessary to meet increased power demands and greenhouse gas reduction targets. Virtually any international energy forecast predicts large growth in nuclear power generation over the next 30–50 years. The expansion of commercial nuclear power production is likely to result in increased radioactive waste generation. Managing this waste effectively is a critical component of a worldwide nuclear renaissance and is a primary consideration for future nuclear fuel cycles. Wastes generated from nuclear power generation can be effectively managed using technologies that are well demonstrated at industrial scales, with decades of safe operating practices. As the worldwide community continues to investigate advanced nuclear fuel cycles, radioactive waste management considerations are being given increased emphasis and are, in fact, being considered at the advent of proposed fuel cycles. This emphasis is necessary to ensure that future nuclear fuel cycles remain economically and environmentally competitive (as compared with other forms of energy production) and do not produce legacy waste management issues for future generations.},

abstract = {What is model selection? What are the goals of model selection? What are the methods of model selection and how do they work? Which methods perform better than others and in what circumstances? These questions rest on a number of key concepts in a relatively underdeveloped field. The aim of this paper is to explain some background concepts, to highlight some of the results in this special issue, and to add my own. The standard methods of model selection include classical hypothesis testing, maximum likelihood, Bayes method, minimum description length, cross-validation, and Akaike's information criterion. They all provide an implementation of Occam's razor, in which parsimony or simplicity is balanced against goodness-of-fit. These methods primarily take account of the sampling errors in parameter estimation, although their relative success at this task depends on the circumstances. However, the aim of model selection should also include the ability of a model to generalize to predictions in a different domain. Errors of extrapolation, or generalization, are different from errors of parameter estimation. So, it seems that simplicity and parsimony may be an additional factor in managing these errors, in which case the standard methods of model selection are incomplete implementations of Occam's razor.

abstract = {In most groundwater applications, measurements of concentration are limited in number and sparsely distributed within the domain of interest. Therefore, interpolation techniques are needed to obtain most likely values of concentration at locations where no measurements are available. For further processing, for example, in environmental risk analysis, interpolated values should be given with uncertainty bounds, so that a geostatistical framework is preferable. Linear interpolation of steady-state concentration measurements is problematic because the dependence of concentration on the primary uncertain material property, the hydraulic conductivity field, is highly nonlinear, suggesting that the statistical interrelationship between concentration values at different points is also nonlinear. We suggest interpolating steady-state concentration measurements by conditioning an ensemble of the underlying log-conductivity field on the available hydrological data in a conditional Monte Carlo approach. Flow and transport simulations for each conditional conductivity field must meet the measurements within their given uncertainty. The ensemble of transport simulations based on the conditional log-conductivity fields yields conditional statistical distributions of concentration at points between observation points. This method implicitly meets physical bounds of concentration values and non-Gaussianity of their statistical distributions and obeys the nonlinearity of the underlying processes. We validate our method by artificial test cases and compare the results to kriging estimates assuming different conditional statistical distributions of concentration. Assuming a beta distribution in kriging leads to estimates of concentration with zero probability of concentrations below zero or above the maximal possible value; however, the concentrations are not forced to meet the advection-dispersion equation.},

In addition to analysis of (129)I, a combination of several radionuclides ((210)Pb, (137)Cs and (14)C) was used to establish an accurate chronology of the sediment profile. The concentration of (129)I exhibits an increasing trend ( approximately 10(7) to approximately 10(9)atoms/g) during the last 40 years, suggesting a significant atmospheric input from the nuclear reprocessing facilities in Sellafield (UK) and La Hague (France). A peak corresponding to fallout from the Chernobyl accident (1986) is clearly distinguishable, whereas the impact of fallout from the nuclear weapons' tests since the early 1950s is not distinguished.},

abstract = {The built environment consumes more natural resources than necessary and therefore generates a large amount of waste. This chapter sheds light on the idea of rethinking construction waste management by reengineering processes and practices to reduce construction waste at source. It examines the concept of waste and definitions. Rethinking waste management in construction requires adopting ‘cyclic’ rather than ‘linear’ approach to design and construction. This requires re-engineering current practice to contribute to a cleaner environment through efficient and cost effective sustainable waste minimization strategies. Following this, the chapter discusses construction waste quantification and source evaluation. It also explores current thinking on construction waste research and appraises the current construction waste management and minimization status in the United Kingdom (UK) in terms of drivers and pressures for change, design and onsite practices, and challenges and enablers. For waste minimization to be effective and self-sustaining, it is important that all stakeholders along the construction supply chain embrace a more proactive approach in dealing with waste. In recognition of the responsibility of the architectural profession, through its leading role in project management and a key player in the construction industry, architects should move beyond the concept of eco-efficiency through bolt-on environmental strategies and strive to adopt eco-effective practices by implementing a holistic approach to design out waste, which will be reinforced in tender documents and implemented during the construction stage, in addition to the capture and dissemination of lessons learnt to inform construction waste reduction baselines and benchmarking in future projects.},

@article{Singh2010,
abstract = {In recent years a growing understanding has emerged regarding the need to expand the modeling paradigm to include conceptual model uncertainty for groundwater models. Conceptual model uncertainty is typically addressed by formulating alternative model conceptualizations and assessing their relative likelihoods using statistical model averaging approaches. Several model averaging techniques and likelihood measures have been proposed in the recent literature for this purpose with two broad categories--Monte Carlo-based techniques such as Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation or GLUE (Beven and Binley 1992) and criterion-based techniques that use metrics such as the Bayesian and Kashyap Information Criteria (e.g., the Maximum Likelihood Bayesian Model Averaging or MLBMA approach proposed by Neuman 2003) and Akaike Information Criterion-based model averaging (AICMA) (Poeter and Anderson 2005). These different techniques can often lead to significantly different relative model weights and ranks because of differences in the underlying statistical assumptions about the nature of model uncertainty. This paper provides a comparative assessment of the four model averaging techniques (GLUE, MLBMA with KIC, MLBMA with BIC, and AIC-based model averaging) mentioned above for the purpose of quantifying the impacts of model uncertainty on groundwater model predictions. Pros and cons of each model averaging technique are examined from a practitioner's perspective using two groundwater modeling case studies. Recommendations are provided regarding the use of these techniques in groundwater modeling practice.},

The last few years have witnessed the emergence of different computational tools aimed to the understanding and modeling of this process at molecular level. Although still rudimentary, these methods are shaping a coherent approach to help in the design of molecules with high affinity and specificity, both in lead discovery and in lead optimization. It is the purpose of this review to illustrate the array of computational tools available to consider selectivity in the design process, to summarize the most relevant applications, and to sketch the challenges ahead.},

@article{Kashparov2007,
abstract = {Long-term field experiments have been carried out in the Chernobyl exclusion zone in order to determine the parameters governing radiochlorine ((36)Cl) transfer to plants from four types of soil, namely, Podzoluvisol, Greyzem, Phaeozem and Chernozem. Radiochlorine concentration ratios (CR=concentration of (36)Cl in the fresh plant material divided by its concentration in the dried soil in the upper 20 cm layer) were obtained in green peas (2.6+/-0.4), onions (1.5+/-0.5), potatoes (8+/-1), clover (90+/-26) and ryegrass (158+/-88) hay, oat seeds (36+/-23) and straw (305+/-159), wheat seeds (35+/-10) and straw (222+/-82). These values correlate with the stable chlorine values for the same plants. It was shown that (36)Cl plant/soil CR in radish roots (CR=9.7+/-1.4) does not depend on the stable chlorine content in the soil (up to 150 mgkg(-1)), soil type and thus, that stable chlorine CR values (9.4+/-1.2) can also be used for (36)Cl. Injection of additional quantities of stable chlorine into the soil (100 mgkg(-1) of dry soil) with fertilizer does not change the soil-to-plant transfer of (36)Cl. The results from a batch experiment showed that chlorine is retained in the investigated soils only by live biota and transfers quickly (in just a few hours) into the soil solution from dry vegetation even without decomposition of dead plants and is integrated in the migration processes in soil.},

@article{Bryant2002,
abstract = {We use methods from exterior differential systems (EDS) to develop a geometric theory of scalar, first-order Lagrangian functionals and their associated Euler-Lagrange PDEs, subject to contact transformations. The first chapter contains an introduction of the classical Poincare-Cartan form in the context of EDS, followed by proofs of classical results, including a solution to the relevant inverse problem, Noether's theorem on symmetries and conservation laws, and several aspects of minimal hypersurfaces. In the second chapter, the equivalence problem for Poincare-Cartan forms is solved, giving the differential invariants of such a form, identifying associated geometric structures (including a family of affine hypersurfaces), and exhibiting certain "special" Euler-Lagrange equations characterized by their invariants. In the third chapter, we discuss a collection of Poincare-Cartan forms having a naturally associated conformal geometry, and exhibit the conservation laws for non-linear Poisson and wave equations that result from this. The fourth and final chapter briefly discusses additional PDE topics from this viewpoint--Euler-Lagrange PDE systems, higher order Lagrangians and conservation laws, identification of local minima for Lagrangian functionals, and Backlund transformations. No previous knowledge of exterior differential systems or of the calculus of variations is assumed.},

Determining damages for past contamination of groundwater by surface discharges of hazardous substances requires knowledge of developments in groundwater hydrology. A review of the scientific literature on the motion of subsurface fluids, public health, and sanitary engineering indicates that by 1940 knowledge was sufficient to argue against surface discharges of harmful fluids. Legal precedent, though inconsistent, proved there was ample awareness of the physical processes and financial liabilities before 1950 to expect careful disposal of liquid wastes to a land surface.},

@article{Hu2008,
abstract = {Many long-lived radionuclides are present in groundwater at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) as a result of 828 underground nuclear weapons tests conducted between 1951 and 1992. In conjunction with a comprehensive geochemical review of radionuclides (3H, 14C, 36Cl, 99Tc and 129I) that are presumably mobile in the subsurface, we synthesized a body of radionuclide activity data measured from groundwater samples collected at 18 monitoring wells, to qualitatively assess their migration at the NTS over distances of hundreds of meters and over timescales of decades. Tritium and 36Cl showed little evidence of retardation, while the transport of 14C may have been retarded by its isotopic exchange with carbonate minerals in the aquifer. Observed local reducing conditions (either natural or test-induced) will impact the mobility of certain redox-sensitive radionuclides (especially 99Tc) that were otherwise soluble and readily transported under oxidizing conditions. Conversely, strongly oxidizing conditions may impact the mobility of 129I which is mobile under reducing conditions. The effect of iodine speciation on its transport deserves further attention. Indication of delayed transport of some "mobile" radionuclides (especially 99Tc) in the groundwater at the NTS suggested the importance of redox conditions of the natural system in controlling the fate and transport of radionuclides, which has implications in the enhanced performance of the potential Yucca Mountain repository, located adjacent to the NTS, to store high-level nuclear wastes as well as management of radionuclide contamination in legacy nuclear operations facilities.},

abstract = {The recovery and processing of metals is one of the oldest recycling measures of mankind and the reasons for this are due to energy saving considerations and to the conservation of primary raw materials. Processes for the treatment of obsolete scrap metal have to be adapted to the most frequently used metals and metal mixtures. Size reduction as well as screen classification and separating procedures are the most common stages in scrap metal processing plants. In this chapter an overview is given showing the typical equipment for the handling of scrap metals. In this context the design and functioning principle of scrap shears as well as shredder and post-shredder plants are discussed. Finally, a new and highly sophisticated method for the segregation of waste metals - the so-called sensor based sorting - is discussed and explained.
This chapter describes the fundamentals of metal recycling. It considers the process of mechanical processing of scrap. These processes are all that is required to produce metals that can be used without any difficulties and without further treatment in metallurgical plants. These metallurgical processes include the machinery that is actually a part of the downstream equipment involved in smelting and refining and thus these processes complete the recycling loop for metals. Mechanical treatment of different waste streams containing metals involves the use of well-established methods, which, as a rule, is profitable because of the high market value of the recovered metals and also because metals do not change their properties with use and hence can be recycled an unlimited number of times. The main aim of the processing methods is to achieve high recovery values as well as the best possible grades of the final metallic products. Newly developed systems such as sensor-based sorters are increasingly being implemented to improve separation efficiencies. Finally, re-smelting of the reclaimed products constitutes the closing of the complete recycling loop for metals.},

The latter is disturbed by effects like parasitic interferences or disparities in the cutoff wavelength of the pixels. Thus, a simple Fourier transform cannot be used to estimate the spectrum of the scene. However, as these defects are deterministic, they can be measured and taken into account by inversion methods. A regularization term can also be added. The first experimental results prove the efficiency of this processing methodology.},

abstract = {This chapter addresses the benefits and drawbacks of various thermal destruction and removal technologies. Chemical reactions at elevated temperatures can yield products that are either good or bad from an environmental perspective. This chapter focuses on the thermal reactions that can be used to treat numerous wastes. Complete combustion may also result in the production of molecular nitrogen (N2) when nitrogen-containing organics are burned, such as in the combustion of methylamine. Incomplete combustion can produce a variety of compounds. Some are more toxic than the original compounds being oxidized, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxins, furans, and CO. The organic portion of wastes has heat value. This means that this portion of any waste can be completely destroyed using principles based on thermodynamics, ultimately yielding carbon dioxide and water. This depends mainly on whether toxic and otherwise harmful molecules react to become less or more toxic or harmful molecules, or are transformed into molecules that are more or less mobile in the environment, which could mean greater exposures and risks. Recalcitrant waste constituents can be degraded using these techniques but caution should always be applied as improper applications of thermal technologies can lead to harm caused by products of incomplete combustion (PICs) and other pollutants.},

The releases from each facility to the atmosphere and to the soil and streams, both from normal operations and inadvertent releases, over the period of operation from the early 1950s through 1988 are presented. The fate of the tritium released is evaluated through environmental monitoring, special studies, and modeling. It is concluded that approximately 91\% of the tritium remaining after decay is now in the oceans. A dose and risk assessment to the population around the site is presented. It is concluded that about 0.6 fatal cancers may be associated with the tritium released during all the years of operation to the population of about 625,000. This same population (based on the overall US cancer statistics) is expected to experience about 105,000 cancer fatalities from all types of cancer. Therefore, it is considered unlikely that a relationship between any of the cancer deaths occurring in this population and releases of tritium from the SRS will be found.},

abstract = {Radiotracer experiments have been conducted in an industrial battery of twelve desanders located at the water treatment plant of Lima. The flow behavior is complex because it includes the superposition of a stochastic flow, which is intrinsic to the process itself, and of a non-stochastic flow induced by local strong currents at the surface. These currents are non-stochastic because they are different from one desander to another one even if all the desanders are identical. A general model has been proposed to simulate the whole behavior of the process. The model is composed of two parts: the first one, describes the stochastic flow behavior, and is the same for each desander; the second one is adapted to represent the turbulent shortcuts at the surface of each desander. The parameters of stochastic part have been determined to be consistent with the physical description of the process. The value of the Peclet number of the shortcut is a monotonic function of the flow rate. Despite remaining uncertainties due both to the complexity of the flow and to specific problems of tracer measurements in large industrial water treatment plant, this paper proposes an extension of the applications of radiotracer experiments and interpretation.},

abstract = {Constructing maps of dry deposition pollution levels is vital for air quality management, and presents statistical problems typical of many environmental and spatial applications. Ideally, such maps would be based on a dense network of monitoring stations, but this does not exist. Instead, there are two main sources of information for dry deposition levels in the United States: one is pollution measurements at a sparse set of about 50 monitoring stations called CASTNet, and the other is the output of the regional scale air quality models, called Models-3. A related problem is the evaluation of these numerical models for air quality applications, which is crucial for control strategy selection. We develop formal methods for combining sources of information with different spatial resolutions and for the evaluation of numerical models. We specify a simple model for both the Models-3 output and the CASTNet observations in terms of the unobserved ground truth, and we estimate the model in a Bayesian way. This provides improved spatial prediction via the posterior distribution of the ground truth, allows us to validate Models-3 via the posterior predictive distribution of the CASTNet observations, and enables us to remove the bias in the Models-3 output. We apply our methods to data on SO2 concentrations, and we obtain high-resolution SO2 distributions by combining observed data with model output. We also conclude that the numerical models perform worse in areas closer to power plants, where the SO2 values are overestimated by the models.},

abstract = {Model selection is a topic of special relevance in molecular phylogenetics that affects many, if not all, stages of phylogenetic inference. Here we discuss some fundamental concepts and techniques of model selection in the context of phylogenetics. We start by reviewing different aspects of the selection of substitution models in phylogenetics from a theoretical, philosophical and practical point of view, and summarize this comparison in table format. We argue that the most commonly implemented model selection approach, the hierarchical likelihood ratio test, is not the optimal strategy for model selection in phylogenetics, and that approaches like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian methods offer important advantages. In particular, the latter two methods are able to simultaneously compare multiple nested or nonnested models, assess model selection uncertainty, and allow for the estimation of phylogenies and model parameters using all available models (model-averaged inference or multimodel inference). We also describe how the relative importance of the different parameters included in substitution models can be depicted. To illustrate some of these points, we have applied AIC-based model averaging to 37 mitochondrial DNA sequences from the subgenus Ohomopterus(genus Carabus) ground beetles described by Sota and Vogler (2001).},

abstract = {The non-aqueous phase-liquid (NAPL)-contaminated aquifer at a major refinery site in Mexico was investigated. Owing to the depth of the contaminated aquifer section (NAPL source zone) of over 100 m below the surface, the actual aquifer material was not accessible for sampling. Information on the residual NAPL contamination of the aquifer could only be obtained indirectly by analysing groundwater samples from a few wells available at the site. To tackle the problem, an approach alternative to conventional groundwater analysis for dissolved NAPL was chosen. For evaluating the recent contamination and estimating its probable future development, the radioisotope radon-222 and the stable isotopes 13C, 34S and 18O were used as naturally occurring contamination tracers and process indicators. Radon was used as partitioning tracer for the approximate localization and semi-quantitative assessment of the NAPL source zone. The stable isotopes were used as indicators for naturally occurring biodegradation processes, which might potentially be implemented into future remediation schemes.},

abstract = {99Tc and 129I are important contributors to risk assessment due to their long half-lives and high mobility as aqueous anionic species. We analyzed 99Tc and 129I in groundwater samples in and near 11 underground nuclear tests and in melt glass and rock samples retrieved from the Chancellor test cavity, Nevada Test Site. The 129I/127I ratio ranges from 10−3 to 10−6 in cavity water and 10−4 to 10−9 in satellite wells. The 99Tc concentration ranges from 3 to 10−4 Bq/l in cavity waters and from 0.3 to 10−4 Bq/l in satellite wells. Downstream migration is apparent for both radionuclides. However, it is affected by both retardation and initial distribution. In-situ 99Tc and 129I K d s calculated using rubble and water concentrations are 3 to 22 ml/g and 0 to 0.12 ml/g, respectively, and are suggestive of mildly reducing conditions. 129I distribution in the melt glass, rubble and groundwater of the Chancellor test cavity is 28\%, 24\% and 48\%, respectively, for 99Tc, it is 65\%, 35\% and 0.3\%, respectively. Our partitioning estimates differ from those of underground tests in French Polynesia, implying that fission product distribution may vary from test to test. Factors that may influence this distribution include geologic conditions (e.g., lithology, water and CO2 content) and the cooling history of the test cavity.},

abstract = {This study examines the applicability of the iron-based degradative solidification/stabilization (DS/S-Fe(II)) process to 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA), which is one of common chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) of concern at contaminated sites. DS/S-Fe(II) combines contaminant degradation by Fe(II) and immobilization by the hydration reactions of Portland cement. The transformation of 1,1,1-TCA by Fe(II) in 10\% Portland cement slurries was studied using a batch slurry reactor system. The effects of Fe(II) dose, pH, and initial concentration of 1,1,1-TCA on the kinetics of 1,1,1-TCA degradation were evaluated. Degradation of 1,1,1-TCA in cement slurries including Fe(II) was very rapid and could be described by a pseudo-first-order rate law. The half-lives for 1,1,1-TCA were measured between 0.4 and 5h when Fe(II) dose ranged from 4.9 to 39.2mM. The pseudo-first-order rate constant increased with pH to a maximum near pH 12.5. A saturation rate equation was able to predict degradation kinetics over a wide range of target organic concentrations and at higher Fe(II) doses. The major transformation product of 1,1,1-TCA in mixtures of Fe(II) and cement was 1,1-dichloroethane (1,1-DCA), which indicates that degradation occurred by a hydrogenolysis pathway. A small amount of ethane was observed. The conversion of 1,1,1-TCA to ethane was better described by a parallel reaction model than by a consecutive reaction model.},

@article{Hwang2008,
abstract = {An earlier field experiment at Canadian Forces Base Borden by Brewster and Annan [Geophysics 59 (1994) 1211] clearly demonstrated the capability of ground penetrating radar (GPR) reflection profiling to detect and monitor the formation of DNAPL layers in the subsurface. Their experiment involved a large volume release (770 L) of tetrachloroethylene into a portion of the sand aquifer that was hydraulically isolated from groundwater flow by sheet pile walls. In this study, we evaluated the ability of GPR profiling to detect and monitor much smaller volume releases (50 L). No subsurface confining structure was used in this experiment; hence, the DNAPL impacted zone was subjected to the natural groundwater flow regime. This condition allowed us to geophysically monitor the DNAPL mass loss over a 66 month period. Reflectivity variations on the GPR profiles were used to infer the presence and evolution of the solvent layers. GPR imaging found significant reflectivity increases due to solvent layer formation during the two week period immediately after the release. These results demonstrated the capacity of GPR profiling for the detection and monitoring of lesser volume DNAPL releases that are more representative of small-scale industrial spills. The GPR imaged solvent layers subsequently reduced in both areal extent and reflectivity after 29 months and almost completely disappeared by the end of the 66 month monitoring period. Total DNAPL mass estimates based on GPR profiling data indicated that the solvent mass was reduced to 34\%-36\% of its maximum value after 29 months; only 4\%-9\% of the solvent mass remained in the study area after 66 months. These results are consistent with independent hydrogeological estimates of remaining DNAPL mass based on the downgradient monitoring of the dissolved solvent phase. Hence, we have concluded that the long-term GPR reflectivity changes of the DNAPL layers are likely the result from the dissolution of chlorinated solvents residing in those layers. The long-term monitoring results demonstrated that GPR profiling is a promising non-invasive method for use at DNAPL contaminated sites in sandy aquifers where temporal information about immiscible contaminant mass depletion due to either natural flow or remediation is needed. However, our results also indicated that the GPR signature of older DNAPL impacted zones may not differ greatly from the uncontaminated background if significant mass reduction due to dissolution has occurred.},

A system of classification of crop plants based on the concept of 'effective foraging space' has been developed. The scope and applicability of the radioisotope methods in different cropping situations as well as from the point of view of radiological safety were discussed.},

abstract = {Earth-orbiting spacecraft have become an integral part of everyone's lives. People depend on them for communications, weather forecasts, scientific research, and national security. A real and growing concern for the safety and reliability of these satellites is the threat from collision with other orbiting objects, including space debris. Even small particles can damage, degrade, or destroy spacecraft due to the very high velocities involved in a collision. The three principal counter measures to this threat that are being used are shielding, collision avoidance, and curtailment of the creation of new debris through design and operational practices. In addition to the obvious due diligence aspect of protecting operational spacecraft, one long-term benefit of collision avoidance is the prevention of collisions between two large objects, which in turn could further degrade near-Earth space with large numbers of new debris, as was the case with the collision of Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. On the other hand, over 99\% of the risk to operational spacecraft from collisions with orbital debris comes from objects too small to track on a routine basis, that is, smaller than 10 cm. Hence, only an improvement in the orbital debris environment itself can dramatically reduce the risks to operational spacecraft.},

abstract = {The impact of climate variability on the water cycle in desert ecosystems is controlled by biospheric feedback at interannual to millennial timescales. This paper describes a unique field dataset from weighing lysimeters beneath nonvegetated and vegetated systems that unequivocally demonstrates the role of vegetation dynamics in controlling water cycle response to interannual climate variability related to El Nino southern oscillation in the Mojave Desert. Extreme El Nino winter precipitation (2.3-2.5 times normal) typical of the U.S. Southwest would be expected to increase groundwater recharge, which is critical for water resources in semiarid and arid regions. However, lysimeter data indicate that rapid increases in vegetation productivity in response to elevated winter precipitation reduced soil water storage to half of that in a nonvegetated lysimeter, thereby precluding deep drainage below the root zone that would otherwise result in groundwater recharge. Vegetation dynamics have been controlling the water cycle in interdrainage desert areas throughout the U.S. Southwest, maintaining dry soil conditions and upward soil water flow since the last glacial period (10,000-15,000 yr ago), as shown by soil water chloride accumulations. Although measurements are specific to the U.S. Southwest, correlations between satellite-based vegetation productivity and elevated precipitation related to El Nino southern oscillation indicate this model may be applicable to desert basins globally. Understanding the two-way coupling between vegetation dynamics and the water cycle is critical for predicting how climate variability influences hydrology and water resources in water-limited landscapes.},

abstract = {A conjugate gradient method (CGM), (or called an iterative regularization method), based inverse algorithm is applied in this study in determining the unknown space and time-dependent contaminant source for groundwater systems based on the measurements of the concentrations. It is assumed that no prior information is available on the functional form of the unknown contaminant release function in the present study; thus, it is classified as the function estimation in the inverse calculations. The accuracy of this inverse mass transfer problem is examined by using the simulated exact and inexact concentration measurements in the numerical experiments. Results show that the estimation on the space and time-dependent contaminant release function can be obtained with any arbitrary initial guesses on a Pentium IV 1.4\&\#xa0;GHz personal computer.},

@incollection{Otterpohl2011,
abstract = {The management of biowaste has undergone significant changes during the last decade as environmental concerns and the need for sustainable use of resources continue to penetrate the public conscience. In this chapter, a systematic short description of commonly implemented sanitation systems is presented. It emphasizes that all reuse-oriented wastewater systems; whether low- or high-tech, have different strengths in contributing to sustainable biowaste management, depending on the specific context, and argues that the key issue as far as the reuse of wastewater is concerned is to collect and treat toilet flow streams (blackwater or dry faecal matter and urine) and wastewater (greywater) separately. The chapter shows how this approach has grown rapidly over the past years, with a clear message that future innovations will need increased focus on managing the solid fraction.
Biowaste management deals with solid waste management, focusing on reusing rather than disposing. There are three main lines of approaching the problem—high-tech systems based mainly on vacuum technology, membrane bioreactors, and biogas plants; urine diverting flush systems; and, finally, the very promising modern dry sanitation systems that can be very cost efficient and furthermore produce black soil and water that can be reused [terra preta sanitation (TPS)]. This chapter provides an overview to some of the different solutions. Integration of the anaerobic dry toilet and vermicomposting thus promises to be an ideal approach for managing wastes; even wastes generated by urban households. The product, terra preta, can address the problems of soil degradation and food insecurity, common in many areas across the world. TPS could become important in the design of highly efficient ecofriendly houses and housing areas with the added value of improved urban agriculture, which can be combined with local greywater reuse. Thus, TPS can close regional cycles and improve hygienic conditions and soil fertility in a sustainable manner with the creation of local added value. There are still questions to be answered such as the issue of macronutrients and also micronutrients.},

abstract = {The federal Early Head Start (EHS) program began in 1995, and a randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of 17 EHS programs. In all, 3,001 low-income families (35\% African American, 24\% Hispanic, and 37\% White) with a pregnant women or an infant under the age of 12 months were randomly assigned to a treatment or control group (with 91\% of the treatment group receiving some services). Data were collected when the children were about 1, 2, and 3 years of age, and at age 5 (2 years after leaving EHS). Research questions examined (1) impacts of EHS at ages 2 and 3 (when services were being offered) and at age 5, and (2) contributions of early education experiences across children's first 5 years of life. Child outcomes included cognition, language, attention, behavior problems, and health; maternal outcomes included parenting, mental health, and employment. Overall impact analyses at ages 2 and 3 indicated that EHS benefited children and families: impacts were seen in all domains, with effect sizes of significant impacts ranging from .10 to .20. At age 5, EHS children had better attention and approaches toward learning as well as fewer behavior problems than the control group, although they did not differ on early school achievement. Subgroup analyses indicated that cognitive impacts were sustained 2 years after the program ended for African American children and language impacts for Hispanic children who spoke Spanish. Some significant family benefits were seen at age 5. Mediated analyses identified which child and family impacts at ages 2 and 3 contributed to the child impacts at age 5 (most relevant were earlier treatment effects on child cognition and on engagement with the parent). Growth curve analyses were also conducted. Although fewer than half the children enrolled in center-based preschool programs between ages 3 and 4, almost 90\% participated in the year preceding kindergarten. A higher percentage of EHS than control children were enrolled. Nonexperimental analyses suggested that formal program participation enhanced children's readiness for school while also increasing parent-reported aggression. At age 5, those children and families who experienced EHS followed by formal programs fared best overall. However, the benefits of the two experiences were associated with outcomes in different ways. Benefits in language, behavior, and parenting were associated primarily with EHS; benefits in early school achievement were associated primarily with preschool attendance.},

abstract = {The proper use of bioaccumulation in the assessment of environmental quality involves accounting for chemical fluxes in organisms. Cadmium (Cd) accumulation kinetics in a soil-plant-snail food chain were therefore investigated in the field under different soil contamination (from 0 to 40 mg kg(-1)), soil pH (6 and 7) and season. Allowing for an accurate and sensitive assessment of Cd transfer to snails, toxicokinetics appears an interesting tool in the improvement of risk assessment procedures and a way to quantify metal bioavailability for a defined target. On the basis of uptake fluxes, snails proved to be sensitive enough to distinguish moderate soil contaminations. The soil pH did not appear, in the range studied, as a modulating parameter of the Cd transfer from soil to snail whereas the season, by influencing the snail mass, may modify the internal concentrations. The present data specifying a time integrated assessment of environmental factors on metal bioavailability and transfer to terrestrial snails should ensure their rational use in environmental biomonitoring.},

abstract = {The present study demonstrates a methodology for optimization of environmental data acquisition. Based on the premise that the worth of data increases in proportion to its ability to reduce the uncertainty of key model predictions, the methodology can be used to compare the worth of different data types, gathered at different locations within study areas of arbitrary complexity. The method is applied to a hypothetical nonlinear, variable density numerical model of salt and heat transport. The relative utilities of temperature and concentration measurements at different locations within the model domain are assessed in terms of their ability to reduce the uncertainty associated with predictions of movement of the salt water interface in response to a decrease in fresh water recharge. In order to test the sensitivity of the method to nonlinear model behavior, analyses were repeated for multiple realizations of system properties. Rankings of observation worth were similar for all realizations, indicating robust performance of the methodology when employed in conjunction with a highly nonlinear model. The analysis showed that while concentration and temperature measurements can both aid in the prediction of interface movement, concentration measurements, especially when taken in proximity to the interface at locations where the interface is expected to move, are of greater worth than temperature measurements. Nevertheless, it was also demonstrated that pairs of temperature measurements, taken in strategic locations with respect to the interface, can also lead to more precise predictions of interface movement.},

abstract = {This chapter provides a brief introductory guide to the challenge of managing plastic solid waste (PSW) to its use as a material and an energy resource. PSW recycling processes can be classified in four major categories, re-extrusion (primary), mechanical (secondary), chemical (tertiary), and energy recovery (quaternary). Each method provides a unique set of advantages that makes it particularly beneficial for specific locations, applications or requirements. Increasing recovery of waste and diverting waste away from landfill play a key role in tackling the environmental impacts of increasing waste volumes. PSW not only represents a significant proportion of the total waste produced but also has the highest potential for energy recovery, having the highest calorific value when compared with other waste fractions. This chapter also presents a review of the current situation in the United Kingdom (UK), European Union (EU), and worldwide in relation to solid waste arising and strategies to address waste management. It also introduces the different routes for PSW management, namely, re-extrusion, mechanical recycling, and energy recovery. Petrochemical recovery via thermochemical treatment is also discussed and in particular some of the thermal treatment options available, namely, gasification, hydrogenation, and pyrolysis, are presented. Finally, it discusses a case study based on pyrolysis.},

@article{Plummer2006,
abstract = {Groundwater from remote parts of the Middle Rio Grande Basin in north-central New Mexico has perchlorate (ClO4-) concentrations of 0.12-1.8 micro/L. Because the water samples are mostly preanthropogenic in age (0-28000 years) and there are no industrial sources in the study area, a natural source of the ClO4- is likely. Most of the samples have Br-, Cl-, and SO4(2-) concentrations that are similar to those of modern bulk atmospheric deposition with evapotranspiration (ET) factors of about 7-40. Most of the ET values for Pleistocene recharge were nearly twice that for Holocene recharge. The N03-/Cl- and CIO-/Cl-ratios are more variable than those of Br-/Cl- or S04(2-)/Cl-. Samples thought to have recharged under the most arid conditions in the Holocene have relatively high N03-/Cl- ratios and low delta 15N values (+1 per mil (\% per thousand)) similar to those of modern bulk atmospheric N deposition. The delta 18O values of the N03- (-4 to 0\% per thousand) indicate that atmospheric N03- was not transmitted directly to the groundwater but may have been cycled in the soils before infiltrating. Samples with nearly atmospheric N03-/CI- ratios have relatively high Cl04- concentrations (1.0-1.8 ug/L) with a nearly constant Cl04-/CI- mole ratio of (1.4 +/- 0.1) x 10(-4), which would be consistent with an average Cl04-concentration of 0.093 0.005 ,ug/L in bulk atmospheric deposition during the late Holocene in north-central NM. Samples thought to have recharged under wetter conditions have higher delta 15N values (+3 to +8 \% per thousando), lower NO3-/Cl- ratios, and lower ClO4-/Cl- ratios than the ones most likely to preserve an atmospheric signal. Processes in the soils that may have depleted atmospherically derived NO3-also may have depleted ClO4- to varying degrees prior to recharge. If these interpretations are correct, then ClO4- concentrations of atmospheric origin as high as 4 microg/L are possible in preanthropogenic groundwater in parts of the Southwest where ET approaches a factor of 40. Higher Cl04- concentrations in uncontaminated groundwater could occur in recharge beneath arid areas where ET is greater than 40, where long-term accumulations of atmospheric salts are leached suddenly from dry soils, or where other (nonatmospheric) natural sources of ClO4- exist.},

Mastering this evolving and multifaceted field of study requires knowledge of the sources and generation of hazardous wastes, the scientific and engineering principles necessary to eliminate the threats they pose to people and the environment, the laws regulating their disposal, and the best or most cost-effective methods for dealing with them.Written for students with some background in engineering, this comprehensive, highly acclaimed text does not only provide detailed instructions on how to solve hazardous waste problems but also guides students to think about ways to approach these problems. Each richly detailed, self-contained chapter ends with a set of discussion topics and problems. Case studies, with equations and design examples, are provided throughout the book to give students the chance to evaluate the effectiveness of different treatment and containment technologies.},

abstract = {This chapter provides a summary of the practical issues associated with the collection of municipal solid waste and of the challenges faced in trying to develop accurate waste collection models. The chapter highlights the variety of materials that are collected and the many collection options available (e.g. containers, vehicles, collection frequencies and methods). Waste collection problems and methods include: locating facilities (e.g. vehicle depots, waste disposal sites); sub-dividing rounds into districts for ease of operation and of optimisation; specifying the aggregation level for the collection points to be modelled (e.g. postcode, street, block) and then estimating the waste volume to be collected from each collection point; and optimising vehicle routes and schedules. The chapter concludes with four case study examples of modelling research results from around the world.
This chapter deals with the process of waste collection. It describes the waste materials that are collected, the collection systems that are typically used, and the types of vehicles and other equipment used. It also explains vehicle routing and scheduling, in terms of its capabilities, limitations, and data requirements, and provides some case study examples from around the world to give an indication of the range of waste collection problems and of what benefits may be achievable through the use of waste collection vehicle routing and scheduling methods. There are many different types and sources of waste, ranging from household garbage to debris found in outer space. This chapter focuses on the collection of municipal solid waste (MSW), which normally comprises waste from households, streets, parks, schools, hospitals, and some commercial businesses. Waste collection is a multi-faceted problem that can be considered at different levels, from the high level, strategic, policy or planning viewpoints, to more low level, tactical or operational decisions. It is very much in the interests of waste collection authorities (WCAs) worldwide to devise efficient working methods to keep their operating costs as low as possible while providing a good level of service to householders, trade customers, and other interested parties.},

abstract = {Formal definitions are given of the following intuitive concepts: (a) A model is quantitatively testable if its predictions are highly precise and narrow. (b) A model is identifiable if the values of its parameters can be ascertained from empirical observations. (c) A model is redundant if the values of some parameters can be deduced from others or if the values of some observables can be deduced from others. Various rules of thumb for nonredundant models are examined. The Counting Rule states that a model is quantitatively testable if and only if it has fewer parameters than observables. This rule can be safely applied only to identifiable models. If a model is unidentifiable, one must apply a generalization of the Counting Rule known as the Jacobian Rule. This rule states that a model is quantitatively testable if and only if the maximum rank (i.e., the number of linearly independent columns) of its Jacobian matrix (i.e., the matrix of partial derivatives of the function that maps parameter values to the predicted values of observables) is smaller than the number of observables. The Identifiability Rule states that a model is identifiable if and only if the maximum rank of its Jacobian matrix equals the number of parameters. The conclusions provided by these rules are only presumptive. To reach definitive conclusions, additional analyses must be performed. To illustrate the foregoing, the quantitative testability and identifiability of linear models and of discrete-state models are analyzed. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {During second quarter 1992, tritium, gross alpha, total alpha-emitting radium (radium-224 and radium-226), nitrate, nonvolatile beta, lead, cadmium, mercury, nickel, radium-228, trichloroethylene, and tetrachloroethylene exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Primary Drinking Water Standards (PDWS) in one or more groundwater samples from monitoring wells at the F-Area Seepage Basins (FASB). Tritium and nitrate were the most widespread constituents; 56 (67\%) of the 84 monitored wells exhibited tritium activities and 41 (49\%) wells contained nitrate concentrations that exceeded the PDWS. These two constituents were found primarily in Aquifer Zone IIB2 (Water Table) and Aquifer Zone IIB 1(Barnwell/McBean). Tritium activities exceeding the PDWS occurred in 8 (44\%) of the 18 Aquifer Unit IIA (Congaree) wells. The highest tritium activity and the highest nitrate concentration were found in Aquifer Zone IIB2 (Water Table). One or more of 49 downgradient Aquifer Zone IIB2 (Water Table) and Aquifer Zone IIB1 (Barnwell/McBean) wells contained levels of tritium, gross alpha, total alpha-emitting radium, nitrate, nonvolatile beta, lead, cadmium, mercury, nickel, trichloroethylene, or tetrachloroethylene that exceeded the PDWS. Upgradient wells FSB 76C and 108D did not contain elevated levels of any of these constituents; however, upgradient wells FSB 99D and 109D exhibited tritium activities that exceeded the PDWS. Upgradient well FSB 99D also contained elevated levels of cadmium. Six downgradient wells in the upper portion of Aquifer Unit IIA (Congaree) contained elevated levels of tritium. Elevated tritium was not found in upgradient wells FSB 76B, 96AR, and 98AR; however, upgradient well FSB 78B exhibited elevated tritium, and upgradient well FSB 79B contained elevated radium-228. No constituents exceeded the PDWS in wells in the lower portion of Aquifer Unit IIA (Congaree).},

@article{Echeverria1989,
abstract = {An acute inhalation chamber study of 42 college students was performed to investigate the relation between exposure to 0, 75, and 150 ppm of toluene and changes in central nervous system function and symptoms. Paid subjects were exposed for seven hours over three days. Verbal and visual short term memory (Sternberg, digit span, Benton, pattern memory); perception (pattern recognition); psychomotor skill (simple reaction time, continuous performance, digit symbol, hand-eye coordination, finger tapping, and critical tracking); manual dexterity (one hole); mood (profile of mood scales (POMS]; fatigue (fatigue checklist); and verbal ability were evaluated at 0800, 1200, and 1600 hours. Voluntary symptoms and observations of sleep were collected daily. An analysis of variance and test for trend was performed on the difference and score for each concentration reflecting an eight hour workday where each subject was their own control. A 3 x 3 Latin square study design evaluated toluene effects simultaneously, controlling for learning across the three days and the solvent order. Intersubject variation in solvent uptake was monitored in breath and urine. A 5-10\% decrement in performance was considered significant if it was consistent with a linear trend at p less than 0.05. Adverse performance at 150 ppm toluene was found at 6.0\% for digit span, 12.1\% for pattern recognition (latency), 5.0\% for pattern memory (number correct), 6.5\% for one hole, and 3.0\% for critical tracking. The number of headaches and eye irritation also increased in a dose response manner. The greatest effect was found for an increasing number of observations of sleep. Overall, no clear pattern of neurobehavioural effects was found consistent with the type 1 central nervous system as classified by the World Health Organisation. Subtle acute effects, however, were found just below and above the ACGIH TLV of 100 ppm toluene, supporting the position that the guideline be lowered since the biological threshold of behavioural effects may be comparable with the TLV.},

abstract = {The key role of a forensic scientist is to assist in determining whether a crime has been committed, and if so, assist in the identification of the offender. Many people hold the belief that a particular item can be conclusively linked to a specific person, place or object. Unfortunately, this is often not achievable in forensic science. In performing their role, scientists develop and test hypotheses. The significance of those hypotheses that cannot be rejected upon completion of all available examinations/analyses is then evaluated. Although one can generally identify the substances present using available techniques, it is generally not possible to distinguish one source of the same substance from another. In such circumstances, although a particular hypothesis cannot be rejected, it cannot be conclusively proven, i.e. the samples could still have originated from different sources. This limitation of not being able to distinguish between sources currently extends to the analysis of other forensic samples including, but not limited to, ignitable liquids, paints, adhesives, textile fibres, plastics, and illicit drugs. Stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) is an additional technique that can be utilised to test a given hypothesis. This technique shows the potential to be able to individualise a range of materials of forensic interest. This paper provides a brief description of the technique, followed by a review of the various applications of IRMS in different scientific fields. The focus of this summary is on forensic applications of IRMS, in particular the analysis of explosives, ignitable liquids and illicit drugs.},

abstract = {Nonhazardous industrial waste (NHIW) is distinct from both municipal solid waste (MSW), the more familiar mix from homes and businesses, and hazardous waste, materials that are more highly regulated owing to their toxicity and related public health concerns. The sheer quantities of NHIW raise the question of how best to manage it. The first defense is cleaner production—generating less waste by increasing industrial efficiency and effectiveness. A broad range of companies now produce annual sustainability reports detailing the amount of waste reduced in particular categories, year to year. For wastes that continue to be generated, many large volume industrial streams are amenable to separate handling such as foundry sand, coal ash, and paper mill sludge, some of these streams have an excellent track record for reuse. Specifically, industrial symbiosis is part of a new field called industrial ecology. Industrial ecology is principally concerned with the flow of materials and energy through systems at different scales, from products to factories and up to national and global levels. Industrial symbiosis focuses on these flows through networks of businesses and other organizations in local and regional economies as a means of approaching ecologically sustainable industrial development. It engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to competitive advantage involving physical exchange of materials, energy, water, and/or by-products. The keys to industrial symbiosis are collaboration and the synergistic possibilities offered by geographic proximity.},

@inproceedings{Heron2004,
abstract = {In May and June 2002, the U.S. Air Force and AFCEE conducted the first application of steam-enhanced remediation in a fractured rock aquifer in the US, at Edwards AFB, Site 61. The site geology consists of a thin layer of alluvium resting on 30 to 40 ft of weathered granitic bedrock, which grades downwards into unweathered frac- tured granitic bedrock with enclaves of weathered diorite. The water table is located at a depth of about 32ft. Groundwater flow is towards the east-southeast, leading to the crea- tion of an elongate plume of chlorinated solvents, principally TCE. Dissolved-phase TCE contamination was present to depths of at least 100 ft, with high levels indicating poten- tial DNAPL presence mainly in the upper 60 ft. The treatability study was designed to evaluate the applicability of steam-enhanced remediation for restoration of fractured rock source zones and aquifers impacted by volatile organic compounds. Steam was injected in three discrete intervals within one nested well to a target depth range from 12 to 60 ft bgs. Contaminant vapors and liquids were extracted from four surrounding wells. The upper 40 ft of the treatment zone was heated within 20 to 30 days of initiation of steam injection. The initial high-vacuum extraction resulted in high concentrations of TCE and other VOCs in the extracted vapor. After 30 days of heating, pressure cycling was initiated, resulting in increased mass removal. After heating one of the extraction wells to over 140°F, LNAPL was recovered in a liquid form. The total mass of contaminants removed from the subsurface was approximately 2,000 to 3,000 pounds, including 250 pounds of LNAPL. After cool-down, soil, rock and water samples were collected to assess the remedial success. Soil and rock concentrations of contaminants were below the detection limit in all samples from the surface to a depth of 32 ft. In the upper part of the saturated area (from 32 to 45 ft below grade), TCE groundwater concentrations were low- ered from 500–2,200 µg/L to 0.8–200 µg/L (approximately 90\% reduction). The results were encouraging: Steam enhanced remediation was recommended as a source zone remediation technology in combination with plume control.},

abstract = {Ocean pollution has become one of the largest and sometimes even conflicting subjects which very often result in threats to marine ecosystems, human health, and diminishing food sources. Ocean waste includes all material that is discarded accidentally or purposefully from vessels, ships, and other ocean transport. It also includes waste that enters waterways and rivers which flows into the sea and also waste from human habitation living in coastal areas close to the sea. Ocean waste can also result from ocean storms waves, tsunamis, and other extreme marine events. Some of these are the result of poor handling of cargo on ships and vessels. In some countries such as the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are responsible, along with the U.S. Navy and the Coast Guard and other agencies, for the management and control of ocean waste. The Inter-agency of the Marine Debris Coordinating Committee are responsible for the rules and regulation and recommendations for the handling this form of waste. In less developed nations such as Mexico, there are also incipient programs to handle ocean waste. It is important that progress be made in controlling waste discharges into the ocean. There is strong evidence that when correct measures are taken, not only the ocean but also land and many organisms are spared from the consequences of chemical pollutants.},

abstract = {At many "real world" field sites, the number of available monitoring wells is limited due to economic or geological reasons. Under such restricted conditions, it is difficult to perform a reliable field investigation and to quantify primary lines of evidence for natural attenuation (NA), like the documentation of a decrease of contaminant mass flux in flow direction. This study reports the results of a groundwater investigation at a former manufactured gas plant situated in a Quaternary river valley in southwest Germany. The location, infrastructure and aquifer setting are typical of many industrial sites in Germany. Due to difficult drilling conditions (coarse glaciofluvial gravel deposits and an anthropogenic fill above the aquifer), only 12 monitoring wells were available for the investigation and localisation of the contaminant plume. These wells were situated along three control planes (CP) downgradient from the contaminant source, with four wells along each plane. Based on the sparse set of monitoring wells, field scale mass fluxes and first-order natural attenuation rate constants of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-xylene and p-xylene (BTEX) and low molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were estimated utilizing different point scale and also a new integral investigation method. The results show that even at a heterogeneous site with a sparse monitoring network point scale investigation methods can provide reliable information on field scale natural attenuation rates, if a dependable flow model or tracer test data is available. If this information is not available, only the new integral investigation method presented can yield adequate results for the quantification of contaminant mass fluxes under sparse monitoring conditions.},

abstract = {This chapter approaches wastes from a life cycle perspective. The best waste is no waste at all, so the waste manager must look for opportunities to prevent the generation of wastes. One tool for identifying and characterizing wastes is the life cycle assessment, which considers products before they are manufactured and after they are disassembled. The energy and matter must be considered thermodynamically.
Traditionally, addressing wastes has often been a matter of reacting to problems as they arose individually in a situationally dependent way. However, the processes that lead to waste can be viewed much more proactively and systematically, with the focus now being on prevention. Engineers and other waste managers have begun to embrace waste minimization, pollution prevention, and other systematic approach, albeit incrementally. Green design and sustainable approaches to waste apply scientific principles to develop objective-oriented, function-based processes. They consider every element of a product's life cycle in a way that mutually benefits the client, the public, and the environment. Waste products can decrease in volume and mass as green designs replace traditional methods of manufacturing, use, and disposal. Wastes must be managed (and, ideally, avoided) by means of applying the laws of science. The better the designer understands these principles, the more likely that the products demanded by society can be produced and used predictably and sustainably. Therefore, strategic use of physical science laws must inform designs and engineering decisions, and forms the crux of green engineering and sustainable aspects of waste management.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterize the temporal behavior of contaminant mass discharge, and the relationship between reductions in contaminant mass discharge and reductions in contaminant mass, for a very heterogeneous, highly contaminated source-zone field site. Trichloroethene is the primary contaminant of concern, and several lines of evidence indicate the presence of organic liquid in the subsurface. The site is undergoing groundwater extraction for source control, and contaminant mass discharge has been monitored since system startup. The results show a significant reduction in contaminant mass discharge with time, decreasing from approximately 1 to 0.15 kg/d. Two methods were used to estimate the mass of contaminant present in the source area at the initiation of the remediation project. One was based on a comparison of two sets of core data, collected 3.5 years apart, which suggests that a significant (\~{} 80\%) reduction in aggregate sediment-phase TCE concentrations occurred between sampling events. The second method was based on fitting the temporal contaminant mass discharge data with a simple exponential source-depletion function. Relatively similar estimates, 784 and 993 kg, respectively, were obtained with the two methods. These data were used to characterize the relationship between reductions in contaminant mass discharge (CMDR) and reductions in contaminant mass (MR). The observed curvilinear relationship exhibits a reduction in contaminant mass discharge essentially immediately upon initiation of mass reduction. This behavior is consistent with a system wherein significant quantities of mass are present in hydraulically poorly accessible domains for which mass removal is influenced by rate-limited mass transfer. The results obtained from the present study are compared to those obtained from other field studies to evaluate the impact of system properties and conditions on mass-discharge and mass-removal behavior. The results indicated that factors such as domain scale, hydraulic-gradient status (induced or natural), and flushing-solution composition had insignificant impact on the CMDR-MR profiles and thus on underlying mass-removal behavior. Conversely, source-zone age, through its impact on contaminant distribution and accessibility, was implicated as a critical factor influencing the nature of the CMDR-MR relationship.},

abstract = {The isotopic composition, size distribution, and redox speciation of plutonium (Pu) in the groundwater in the vicinity of the F-area seepage basins at the U.S. Department of Energy Savannah River Site (SRS) were examined. A low 240Pu/239Pu ratio in the upstream control well signifies a Pu source otherthan global fallout and indicates reactor-produced Pu. Elevated 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios downstream from the seepage basins are due to the decay of transplutonium isotopes, mainly 244Cm to 240Pu, which were generated at the SRS. Evidence suggests that the migration of basin-released Pu isotopes is minor. Rather, it is the transplutonium isotopes that migrate preferentially downstream and in the process decay to yield progeny Pu isotopes. Size fractionation studies with cross-flow ultrafiltration show that <4\% of the 239Pu or 240Pu is found in the colloidal fraction, a finding that is consistent with the higher Pu oxidation states observed in the SRS groundwater. The observation of a low abundance of colloid-associated Pu in SRS groundwater cannot be extrapolated to all sites, but is in contrast to the conclusions of prior groundwater Pu studies at the SRS and elsewhere. This work is unique in its application of a novel combination of sampling and processing protocols as well as its use of thermal ionization mass spectrometry for the detection of Pu isotopes. This allows quantification of the Pu source terms and better determination of the ambient Pu size and redox speciation representative of in situ conditions.},

In this report the procedure to assess 99Tc and 129I content in liquid samples using liquid-scintillation counting is presented. 99Tc and 129I are adsorbed on AG 1 X2 ion-exchange resin. 129I is then eluted with NaOCl and further purified by liquid-liquid extraction using carbon tetrachloride and an aqueous solution of sodium thiosulphate. 99Tc is eluted with hot nitric acid (6 M/60 degrees C). If necessary any 60Co present in the sample is separated by liquid-liquid extraction of the cobalt-TTA complex with iso-BuOH. The overall recovery yield is 96.5 +/- 2.5\% for 99Tc and 90.1 +/- 6.2\% for 129I. Finally beta-activity is measured by liquid-scintillation counting. A limit of detection of 5 Bq/L can thus be obtained for both 99Tc and 129I.},

abstract = {Iodine is an important trace element in geological and biological processes. We summarize here recent results and new data of experiments and observations carried out to improve the understanding of concentration levels and behavior of natural and anthropogenic iodine nuclides in the global environment. The distribution of stable iodine in the Earth's crust was estimated using concentration data in a suite of representative samples and the influence of subduction on the marine iodine cycle was investigated using (129)I systematics on iodine-rich brines from Japan. The importance of microorganisms for the natural iodine cycle is shown in recent studies of iodine sorption on soil and of iodine volatilization from terrestrial and marine environments. Levels of anthropogenic (129)I were measured in samples collected around a spent fuel reprocessing plant in Japan.},

abstract = {Clay materials typically contain negative surface charges that induce electrostatic fields (or diffuse double layers) in electrolytes. During ion diffusion in a porous medium of clay materials, ions dynamically interact with the electrostatic fields associated with individual clay grains by depressing or expanding the electrostatic double layers, which subsequently affects ionic fluxes. Current theory of ion transport in porous media, however, cannot explicitly account for the dynamic interactions. Here we proposed a model by coupling electrodynamics and nonequilibrium thermodynamics (EDNT) to describe ion diffusion in clay materials as a complex function of factors including clay surface charge density, tortuosity, porosity, chemicoosmotic coefficient, and ion self-diffusivity. The model was validated by comparing the calculated and measured apparent ion diffusion coefficients in clay materials as a function of ionic strength. At transitional states, ion diffusive fluxes are dynamically related to the electrostatic fields, which shrink or expand as ion diffusion occurs. At steady states, the electrostatic fields are time-invariant and ion diffusive fluxes conform to flux and concentration gradient relationships; and apparent diffusivity can be approximated by the ion diffusivity in bulk electrolytes corrected by a tortuosity factor and macroscopic concentration discontinuities at the interfaces between clay materials and bulk solutions.},

abstract = {Forty-eight soil profiles down to a depth of 40 cm were taken in Russia and Ukraine in 1995 and 1997, respectively, in order to investigate the feasibility of retrospective dosimetry of the 131I exposure after the Chernobyl accident via the long-lived 129I. The sampling sites covered areas almost not affected by fallout from the Chernobyl accident such as Moscow/Russia and the Zhitomir district in Ukraine as well as the highly contaminated Korosten and Narodici districts in Ukraine. 129I was analyzed by radiochemical neutron activation analysis (RNAA) and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). 127I was measured for some profiles by RNAA or ion chromatography (IC). The results for 127I demonstrated large differences in the capabilities of the soils to store iodine over long time spans. The depth profiles of 129I and of 137Cs showed large differences in the migration behavior between the two nuclides but also for each nuclide among the different sampling sites. Though it cannot be quantified how much 129I and 137Cs was lost out of the soil columns into deeper depths, the inventories in the columns were taken as proxies for the total inventories. For 129I, these inventories were at least three orders of magnitude higher than a pre-nuclear value of 0.084+/-0.017 mBq m(-2) derived from a soil profile taken in 1939 in Lutovinovo/Russia. From the samples from Moscow and Zhitomir, a pre-Chernobyl 129I inventory of (44+/-24) mBq m(-2) was determined, limiting the feasibility of 129I retrospective dosimetry to areas where the 129I inventories exceed 100 mBq m(-2). Higher average 129I inventories in the Korosten and Narodici districts of 130 and 848 mBq m(-2), respectively, allowed determination of the 129I fallout due to the Chernobyl accident. Based on the total 129I inventories and on literature data for the atomic ratio of 129I/131I=13.6+/-2.8 for the Chernobyl emissions and on aggregated dose coefficients for 131I, the thyroid exposure due to 131I after the Chernobyl accident was estimated for the inhabitants of four villages in the Korosten and of three villages in the Narodici districts. The limitations and uncertainties of the 129I retrospective dosimetry are discussed.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine how structure, stratigraphy, and weathering influence fate and transport of contaminants (particularly U) in the ground water and geologic material at the Department of Energy (DOE) Environmental Remediation Sciences Department (ERSD) Field Research Center (FRC). Several cores were collected near four former unlined adjoining waste disposal ponds. The cores were collected, described, analyzed for U, and compared with ground water geochemistry from surrounding multilevel wells. At some locations, acidic U-contaminated ground water was found to preferentially flow in small remnant fractures weathering the surrounding shale (nitric acid extractable U [U(NA)] usually < 50 mg kg(-1)) into thin (<25 cm) Fe oxide-rich clayey seams that retain U (U(NA) 239 to 375 mg kg(-1)). However, greatest contaminant transport occurs in a 2 to 3 m thick more permeable stratigraphic transition zone located between two less permeable, and generally less contaminated zones consisting of (i) overlying unconsolidated saprolite (U(NA) < 0.01 to 200 mg kg(-1)) and (ii) underlying less-weathered bedrock (U(NA) generally < 0.01 to 7 mg kg(-1)). In this transition zone, acidic (pH < 4) U-enriched ground water (U of 38 mg L(-1)) has weathered away calcite veins resulting in greater porosity, higher hydraulic conductivity, and higher U contamination (U(NA) 106 to 745 mg kg(-1)) of the weathered interbedded shale and sandstone. These characteristics of the transition zone produce an interval with a high flux of contaminants that could be targeted for remediation.},

@article{Corbett1997,
abstract = {The groundwater contribution into Par Pond, a former cooling reservoir
for two nuclear reactors located on the Department of Energy's Savannah
River Site (South Carolina), was estimated using a standard hydrologic
budget as well as one augmented by a natural tracer approach. We
determined a geochemical budget for 222Rn, normally found at much
higher concentrations in groundwater than surface waters, to assist
in constraining the hydrologic estimates. The radon budget accounted
for all quantifiable surface sources and sinks including the flux
across the sediment-water interface which was determined by application
of an advection-diffusion model. All hydrologic parameters and radon
concentrations were monitored seasonally from February 1994 to August
1995. Using the water balance approach alone, the average groundwater
discharge entering the lake was estimated to have an upper limit
of approximately 0.95 � 0.13 m3 s-1. The groundwater contribution
obtained using the combined hydrologic/222Rn approach ranged from
0.17 to 0.76 m3 s-1 with a best estimate of 0.35 � 0.16 m3 s-1. Lake
profiles show enhanced 222Rn concentrations in some areas indicating
that groundwater enters Par Pond mostly through a small region in
the northern portion of the lake, probably via small seeps or springs.
Estimates show that groundwater plays a significant role in the overall
water budget of the lake, accounting for 10\%-33\% of the total estimated
inflow from all measured sources. Our results show that supplementing
a standard hydrological water balance with radon budget considerations
helps to constrain estimated groundwater flow into surface reservoirs.},

After closure and capping in 1991, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has being monitoring and remediating the groundwater plume. Despite numerous studies of the plume, its persistence for over 20 years has not been well understood. To better understand the plume dynamics, a limited number of deep boreholes were drilled to determine the current plume characteristics. A mixing model was developed to predict plume tritium and nitrate concentrations. We found that the plume trailing edges have emerged for some contaminants, and that contaminant recharge from the basin's vadose zone is still important. The model's estimated time-dependent basin drainage rates combined with dilution from natural recharge successfully predicted plume tritium and nitrate concentrations. This new understanding of source zone influences can help guide science-based remediation, and improve predictions of the natural attenuation timeframes.},

Like other facets of developmental activities, agriculture too has been a major source of environmental pollution and waste generation. In this context, this chapter provides an overview of the complexities of agricultural wastes, their impacts and possible options to manage them. Agricultural waste refers to waste produced as a result of various agricultural operations. It includes manure and other wastes from farms, poultry houses and slaughterhouses; harvest waste; fertilizer run- off from fields; pesticides that enter into water, air or soils; and salt and silt drained from fields. Agriculture management is a complex process involving individual attention to address the issues related to all functional components such as water, fertilizers, and biocides. A significant constraint encountered in managing agriculture waste is lack of data pertaining to different geographical regions. Therefore, the urgent need is to formulate a tangible mechanism to create an international database on the quantity, composition and characteristics of agro wastes. Preparation of a compendium flagging the success stories and challenges in respect of developed and developing economies would serve well for officials in governance and on the field.},

abstract = {Perchlorate, an iodide uptake inhibitor, is increasingly being detected in new places and new matrices. Perchlorate contamination has been attributed largelyto the manufacture and use of ammonium perchlorate (the oxidizer in solid fuel rockets) and/or the earlier use of Chilean nitrate as fertilizer (approximately 0.1\% perchlorate). However, there are regions such as the southern high plains (Texas Panhandle) where there is no clear historical or current evidence of the extensive presence of rocket fuel or Chilean fertilizer sources. The occurrence of easily measurable concentrations of perchlorate in such places is difficult to understand. In the southern high plains groundwater, perchlorate is better correlated with iodate, known to be of atmospheric origin, compared to any other species. We show that perchlorate is readily formed by a variety of simulated atmospheric processes. For example, it is formed from chloride aerosol by electrical discharge and by exposing aqueous chloride to high concentrations of ozone. We report that perchlorate is present in many rain and snow samples. This strongly suggests that some perchlorate is formed in the atmosphere and a natural perchlorate background of atmospheric origin should exist.},

An unconfined floodplain aquifer near Missoula, MT, was instrumented with 89 monitoring wells and 20 four-port multilevel samplers. Bromide, bacteriophages MS2, PRD1 and [empty set]X174 and the attenuated enterovirus, polio virus (type-1 CHAT strain), were seeded into the aquifer as slug injections. Bromide transport rates ranged between 22-29�m/d. Input concentrations of the tracers and the placement of monitoring wells limited detection of bromide and polio virus to 19.4�m and the detection of three bacteriophage to 40.5�m downgradient from the injection point. After 7.5�m of transport, the calculated relative attenuations [Harvey R. W and Garabedian S. P. (1991) Env. Sci. Tech. 25, 178-185] for MS2, PRD-1, [empty set]X174 and attenuated polio virus were 49, 71, 65 and 99\%, respectively. During the 72-h experiment, die-off was negligible (less than 1\%) and attachment of virus to sediment surfaces resulted in the overall differences in bromide and virus behavior. Although relative attenuations at downgradient monitoring wells indicated that the virus tracers were attaching to aquifer material along the flowpath, virus peaks arrived at observation wells at rates similar to the bromide peak. The high collision efficiency of the attenuated polio virus resulted in breakthrough curve truncation. Natural attenuation of slug input virus over a },

abstract = {This study estimates the effects of sediment deposition/resuspension on radionuclide aqueous transport. For radionuclides that adsorb onto suspended sediment, the omission of deposition/resuspension effects overestimates the downstream radionuclide peak concentration and is therefore conservative. For the case of cesium transport in the Fourmile Branch, the calculated reduction in peak concentration as the cesium is transported downstream is greater with sediment deposition modeled than without. For example, including the effects of sediment deposition/resuspension in the STREAM II calculation results in a 72\% reduction in the downstream (5075 meters downstream from H-Area) peak cesium concentration. It is important to note that the high partition coefficient appropriate for cesium enhances the importance of sediment deposition/resuspension; the reduction in the calculated peak concentration would be less for radioisotopes with lower partition coefficients.},

abstract = {Organisms and ecosystems survive within a finite range of environmental conditions. One of the key factors in these conditions is the temperature range. From a waste management perspective, heat is both a friend and foe. When properly designed and operated, incinerators and other thermal technologies reduce municipal and industrial wastes in volume and change their physical and chemical properties to make these wastes less toxic and more easily manageable. However, if not operated properly, these same technologies can form very toxic chemical compounds. Thermal pollutants can affect the environment in every phase and environmental media. Heat may be a water pollutant if its addition directly or indirectly harms the biota living in surface wards. Complete destruction of a toxic compound versus the release of even more toxic compounds in an incinerator can be determined by a relatively small temperature range. Adding heat to a stream or other ecosystem can completely alter its biological integrity. Food chains and the health of human populations are affected by direct heating or by the indirect effects of added heat. Thus, waste management must always devote attention to these and other possible impacts from heat in the design and operation of systems.},

Savannah River Site (SRS) to assess current3H, 99Tc, and 129I concentrations
in the water. The SRS is a nuclear facility operated by Westinghouse
Savannah River Company for the US Department of Energy. Water quality
parameters were measured at the time of collection using field portable
instrumentation. The tritium activity was determined by liquid scintillation
spectrometry. The isotopes, 99Tc and 129I, were determined by isotope
dilution/inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (D.M. Beals,

found in some surface streams of the SRS, principally due to migration
of ground water from beneath old seepage basins, however the levels
in the waters leaving the SRS are well below any regulatory guidelines.},

@article{Conant2004,
abstract = {An investigation of a tetrachloroethene (PCE) groundwater plume originating at a dry cleaning facility on a sand aquifer and discharging to a river showed that the near-river zone strongly modified the distribution, concentration, and composition of the plume prior to discharging into the surface water. The plume, streambed concentration, and hydrogeology were extensively characterized using the Waterloo profiler, mini-profiler, conventional and driveable multilevel samplers (MLS), Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys, streambed temperature mapping (to identify discharge zones), drivepoint piezometers, and soil coring and testing. The plume observed in the shallow streambed deposits was significantly different from what would have been predicted based on the characteristics of the upgradient plume. Spatial and temporal variations in the plume entering the near-river zone contributed to the complex contaminant distribution observed in the streambed where concentrations varied by factors of 100 to 5000 over lateral distances of less than 1 to 3.5 m. Low hydraulic conductivity semi-confining deposits and geological heterogeneities at depth below the streambed controlled the pattern of groundwater discharge through the streambed and influenced where the plume discharged into the river (even causing the plume to spread out over the full width of the streambed at some locations). The most important effect of the near-river zone on the plume was the extensive anaerobic biodegradation that occurred in the top 2.5 m of the streambed, even though essentially no biodegradation of the PCE plume was observed in the upgradient aquifer. Approximately 54\% of the area of the plume in the streambed consisted solely of PCE transformation products, primarily cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride (VC). High concentrations in the interstitial water of the streambed did not correspond to high groundwater-discharge zones, but instead occurred in low discharge zones and are likely sorbed or retarded remnants of past high-concentration plume discharges. The high-concentration areas (up to 5529 microg/l of total volatile organics) in the streambed are of ecological concern and represent potential adverse exposure locations for benthic and hyporheic zone aquatic life, but the effect of these exposures on the overall health of the river has yet to be determined. Even if the upgradient source of PCE is remediated and additional PCE is prevented from reaching the streambed, the high-concentration deposits in the streambed will likely take decades to hundreds of years to flush completely clean under natural conditions because these areas have low vertical groundwater flow velocities and high retardation factors. Despite high concentrations of contaminants in the streambed, PCE was detected in the surface water only rarely due to rapid dilution in the river and no cDCE or VC was detected. Neither the sampling of surface water nor the sampling of the groundwater from the aquifer immediately adjacent to the river gave an accurate indication of the high concentrations of PCE biodegradation products present in the streambed. Sampling of the interstitial water of the shallow streambed deposits is necessary to accurately characterize the nature of plumes discharging to rivers.},

@article{Hunkeler2004,
abstract = {Chlorinated ethenes often migrate over extended distances in aquifers and may originate from different sources. The aim of this study was to determine whether stable carbon isotope ratios remain constant during dissolution and transport of chlorinated ethenes and whether the ratios can be used to link plumes to their sources. Detailed depth-discrete delineation of the carbon isotope ratio in a tetrachloroethene (PCE) plume and in a trichloroethene (TCE) plume was done along cross-sections orthogonal to groundwater flow in two sandy aquifers in the Province of Ontario, Canada. At the TCE site, TCE concentrations up to solubility were measured in one high concentration zone close to the bottom of the aquifer from where dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) was collected. A laboratory experiment using the DNAPL indicated that only very small carbon isotope fractionation occurs during dissolution of TCE (0.26 per thousand), which is consistent with field observations. At most sampling points, the delta(13)C of dissolved TCE was similar to that of the DNAPL except for a few sampling points at the bottom of the aquifer close to the underlying aquitard. At these points, a (13)C enrichment of up to 2.4 per thousand was observed, which was likely due to biodegradation and possibly preferential diffusion of TCE with (12)C into the aquitard. In contrast to the TCE site, several distinct zones of high concentration were observed at the PCE site and from zones to zone, the delta(13)C values varied substantially from -24.3 per thousand to -33.6 per thousand. Comparison of the delta(13)C values in the high concentration zones made it possible to divide the plume in the three different domains, each probably representing a different episode and location of DNAPL release. The three different zones could still be distinguished 220 m from the DNAPL sources. This demonstrates that carbon isotope ratios can be used to differentiate between different zones in chlorinated ethene plumes and to link plume zones to their sources. In addition, subtle variations in delta(13)C at plume fringes provided insight into mechanisms of plume spreading in transverse vertical direction. These variations were identified because of the high-resolution provided by the monitoring network.},

@article{Beven1989,
abstract = {This paper argues that there are fundamental problems in the application of physically-based models for practical prediction in hydrology. These problems result from limitations of the model equations relative to a heterogeneous reality; the lack of a theory of subgrid scale integration; practical constraints on solution methodologies; and problems of dimensionality in parameter calibration. It is suggested that most current applications of physically-based models use them as lumped conceptual models at the grid scale. Recent papers on physically-based models have misunderstood and misrepresented these limitations. There are practical hydrological problems requiring physically-based predictions, and there will continue to be a need for physically-based models but ideas about their capabilities must change so that future applications attempt to obtain realistic estimates of the uncertainty associated with their predictions, particularly in the case of evaluating future scenarios of the effects of management strategies.},

@article{Singh,
abstract = {Groundwater pollution sources are characterized by spatially and temporally varying source locations, injection rates, and duration of activity. Concentration measurement data at specified observation locations are generally utilized to identify these sources characteristics. Identification of unknown groundwater pollution sources in terms of these source characteristics becomes more difficult in the absence of complete breakthrough curves of concentration history at all the time steps. If concentration observations are missing over a length of time after an unknown source has become active, it is even more difficult to correctly identify the unknown sources. An artificial neural network (ANN) based methodology is developed to identify these source characteristics for such a missing data scenario, when concentration measurement data over an initial length of time is not available. The source characteristics and the corresponding concentration measurements at time steps for which it is not missing, constitute a pattern for training the ANN. A groundwater flow and transport numerical simulation model is utilized to generate the necessary patterns for training the ANN. Performance evaluation results show that the back-propagation based ANN model is essentially capable of extracting hidden relationship between patterns of available concentration measurement values, and the corresponding sources characteristics, resulting in identification of unknown groundwater pollution sources. The performance of the methodology is also evaluated for different levels of noise (or measurement errors) in concentration measurement data at available time steps.},

abstract = {There is a continual supply of new experimental data that are relevant to the assessment of the potential impacts of nuclear fuel waste disposal. In the biosphere, the traditional assessment models are data intensive, and values are needed for several thousand parameters. This is augmented further when measures of central tendency, statistical dispersion, correlations and truncations are required for each parameter to allow probabilistic risk assessment. Recent reviews proposed values for 10-15 key element-specific parameters relevant to (36)Cl, (129)I, (222)Rn, (226)Ra, (237)Np and (238)U, and some highlights from this data update are summarized here. Several parameters for Np are revised downward by more than 10-fold, as is the fish/water concentration ratio for U. Soil solid/liquid partition coefficients, Kd, are revised downward by 10-770-fold for Ra. Specific parameters are discussed in detail, including degassing of I from soil; sorption of Cl in soil; categorization of plant/soil concentration ratios for U, Ra and Np; Rn transfer from soil to indoor air; Rn degassing from surface water; and the Ca dependence of Ra transfers.},

@article{Oreskes1998,
abstract = {The present regulatory climate has led to increasing demands for scientists to attest to the predictive reliability of numerical simulation models used to help set public policy, a process frequently referred to as model validation. But while model validation may reveal useful information, this paper argues that it is not possible to demonstrate the predictive reliability of any model of a complex natural system in advance of its actual use. All models embed uncertainties, and these uncertainties can and frequently do undermine predictive reliability. In the case of lead in the environment, we may categorize model uncertainties as theoretical, empirical, parametrical, and temporal. Theoretical uncertainties are aspects of the system that are not fully understood, such as the biokinetic pathways of lead metabolism. Empirical uncertainties are aspects of the system that are difficult (or impossible) to measure, such as actual lead ingestion by an individual child. Parametrical uncertainties arise when complexities in the system are simplified to provide manageable model input, such as representing longitudinal lead exposure by cross-sectional measurements. Temporal uncertainties arise from the assumption that systems are stable in time. A model may also be conceptually flawed. The Ptolemaic system of astronomy is a historical example of a model that was empirically adequate but based on a wrong conceptualization. Yet had it been computerized--and had the word then existed--its users would have had every right to call it validated. Thus, rather than talking about strategies for validation, we should be talking about means of evaluation. That is not to say that language alone will solve our problems or that the problems of model evaluation are primarily linguistic. The uncertainties inherent in large, complex models will not go away simply because we change the way we talk about them. But this is precisely the point: calling a model validated does not make it valid. Modelers and policymakers must continue to work toward finding effective ways to evaluate and judge the quality of their models, and to develop appropriate terminology to communicate these judgments to the public whose health and safety may be at stake.},

abstract = {Paper is probably the most commonly recycled material in use today and has been reused in the papermaking process since the industrialization of the process in the early nineteen century. Although over 60\% of all paper produced in the United States is recovered, paper still makes up over 30\% of the municipal solid waste stream. Because of its high recovery rate, recovered paper is as important a raw material for papermaking as is chemically pulped virgin fiber. Recovered paper comes from a number of different sources, including postconsumer paper, which is recycled after it has served its useful purpose. Because of the wide variety of paper that is recovered, a number of organizations have standardized recovered paper grades in terms of the quality and cleanliness of the material. Paper recycling will continue long into the future as it is a key raw material in the papermaking process.
Recovered paper, or waste paper, can come from a number of different sources, including internally at the paper mill. A number of different terms are used to indicate when in the life cycle of the paper that it is returned for recycling. Recovered paper collection is done in a number of different ways, depending on the type of paper being collected and the source of the paper. In general, preconsumer recycled paper is easier to collect as it tends to be concentrated in specific manufacturing locations and also tends to be much more homogeneous. These collections, often of the form of cuttings, trimmings and over issues, are typically baled and packaged directly at the collection site with little additional processing needed. Paper recycling is a key raw material for the papermaking process, representing a significant portion of the fiber used. However, because of the degradation of the fibers through the papermaking and recycling process, the limit to the amount of paper being recycled is slowly being approached. In addition, there are a number of grades of paper that are currently not recycled and will not be in the foreseeable future. This is particularly true for such personal care products such as toweling and tissue. Future improvements in recycling will need to deal mainly with the fiber quality issues.},

abstract = {
Although progress has been made toward understanding the surface chemistry of granular iron and the mechanisms through which it attenuates groundwater contaminants, potential long-term changes in the solute transport properties of granular iron media have until now received relatively little attention. As part of column investigations of alterations in the reactivity of granular iron, studies using tritiated water (3H2O) as a conservative and non-partitioning tracer were periodically conducted to independently isolate transport-related effects on performance from those more directly related to surface reactivity. Hydraulic residence time distributions (HRTDs) within each of six 39-cm columns exposed to bicarbonate solutions were obtained over the course of 1100 days of operation. First moment analyses of the data revealed generally modest increases in mean pore water velocity (v) over time, indicative of decreasing water-filled porosity. Gravimetric measurements provided independent estimates of water-filled porosity that were initially consistent with those obtained from 3H2O tracer tests, although at later times, porosities derived from gravimetric measurements deviated from the tracer test results owing to mineral precipitation. The combination of gravimetric measurements and 3H2O tracer studies furnished estimates of precipitated mineral mass; depending on the assumed identity of the predominant mineral phase(s), the porosity decrease associated with solute precipitation amounted to 6-24\% of the initial porosity. The accumulation of mineral and gas phases led to the formation of regions of immobile water and increased spreading of the tracer pulse. Application of a dual-region transport model to the 3H2O breakthrough curves revealed that the immobile water-filled region increased from initially negligible values to amounts ranging between 3\% and 14\% of the total porosity in later periods of operation. For the aged columns, mobile-immobile mass transfer coefficients (kmt) were generally in the range of 0.1-1.0 day-1 and reflected a slow exchange of 3H2O between the two regions. Additional model calculations incorporating sorption and reaction suggest that although changes in HRTD can have an appreciable effect on trichloroethylene (TCE) transformation, the effect is likely to be minor relative to that stemming from passivation of the granular iron surface.},

abstract = {We use log permeability and porosity data obtained from single-hole pneumatic packer tests in six boreholes drilled into unsaturated fractured tuff near Superior, Arizona, to postulate, calibrate and compare five alternative variogram models (exponential, exponential with linear drift, power, truncated power based on exponential modes, and truncated power based on Gaussian modes) of these parameters based on four model selection criteria ( AIC , AICc , BIC and KIC ). Relying primarily on KIC and cross-validation we select the first three of these variogram models and use them to parameterize log air permeability and porosity across the site via kriging in terms of their values at selected pilot points and at some single-hole measurement locations. For each of the three variogram models we estimate log air permeabilities and porosities at the pilot points by calibrating a finite volume pressure simulator against two cross-hole pressure data sets from sixteen boreholes at the site. The traditional Occam’s window approach in conjunction with AIC , AICc , BIC and KIC assigns a posterior probability of nearly 1 to the power model. A recently proposed variance window approach does the same when applied in conjunction with AIC , AICc , BIC but spreads the posterior probability more evenly among the three models when used in conjunction with KIC . We compare the abilities of individual models and MLBMA, based on both Occam and variance windows, to predict space–time pressure variations observed during two cross-hole tests other than those employed for calibration. Individual models with the largest posterior probabilities turned out to be the worst or second worst predictors of pressure in both validation cases. Some individual models predicted pressures more accurately than did MLBMA. MLBMA was far superior to any of the individual models in one validation test and second to last in the other validation test in terms of predictive coverage and log scores.},

Tritium was chosen as the first radionuclide in the series because the calculations used to assess the dose to the offsite population from SRS releases indicate that the dose due to tritium, through of small consequence, is one of the most important the radionuclides. This was recognized early in the site operation, and extensive measurements of tritium in the atmosphere, surface water, and ground water exist due to the effort of the Environmental Monitoring Section. In addition, research into the transport and fate of tritium in the environment has been supported at the SRS by both the local Department of Energy (DOE) Office and DOE's Office of Health and Environmental Research.},

abstract = {The use of fibers and fiber containing goods is widespread. The main end-applications comprise apparel as well as home furnishing. Because fibers can be found in a great variety of products, it is to be expected that fibers end up in diverse waste streams. Waste is increasingly being seen as (secondary) raw material, and zero waste represents the current ideal in waste management. Fibers and fiber containing products have followed the same trend towards sustainability. Because fiber production and textile processing are sophisticated and demands large amounts of energy, reuse and recycling are highly recommended, not only for ecological reasons but also for economic reasons. Unfortunately, because fiber reprocessing is difficult and complex, a large portion of fibrous waste still ends up in landfill sites or, largely based on legislative forces, in waste incinerators. A variety of methods do exist for treating waste and end-of-life textiles. Legislation plays an important role in the treatment of waste. From an economical point of view, textile waste exhibits an exceptional position. Zero waste is an extensively used keyword today. It refers to the reuse and recycling of waste and the avoidance of landfilling and combustion. Finally, environmental and ethical attitudes can significantly influence waste treatment.},

@article{Dai2002a,
abstract = {The isotopic composition, size distribution, and redox speciation of plutonium (Pu) in the groundwater in the vicinity of the F-area seepage basins at the U.S. Department of Energy Savannah River Site (SRS) were examined. A low 240Pu/239Pu ratio in the upstream control well signifies a Pu source otherthan global fallout and indicates reactor-produced Pu. Elevated 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios downstream from the seepage basins are due to the decay of transplutonium isotopes, mainly 244Cm to 240Pu, which were generated at the SRS. Evidence suggests that the migration of basin-released Pu isotopes is minor. Rather, it is the transplutonium isotopes that migrate preferentially downstream and in the process decay to yield progeny Pu isotopes. Size fractionation studies with cross-flow ultrafiltration show that <4\% of the 239Pu or 240Pu is found in the colloidal fraction, a finding that is consistent with the higher Pu oxidation states observed in the SRS groundwater. The observation of a low abundance of colloid-associated Pu in SRS groundwater cannot be extrapolated to all sites, but is in contrast to the conclusions of prior groundwater Pu studies at the SRS and elsewhere. This work is unique in its application of a novel combination of sampling and processing protocols as well as its use of thermal ionization mass spectrometry for the detection of Pu isotopes. This allows quantification of the Pu source terms and better determination of the ambient Pu size and redox speciation representative of in situ conditions.},

abstract = {We consider advective-reactive solute transport in porous media whose hydraulic and transport properties are uncertain. These properties are treated as random fields, which renders nonlinear advection-reaction transport equations stochastic. We derive a deterministic equation for the probability density function (PDF) of the concentration of a solute that undergoes heterogeneous reactions, e.g., precipitation or dissolution. The derivation treats exactly (without linearization) a reactive term in the transport equation which accounts for uncertainty (randomness) in both flow velocity and kinetic rate constants but requires a closure, such as a Large-Eddy-Diffusivity (LED) approximation used in the present analysis. No closure is required when reaction rates are the only source of uncertainty. We use exact concentration PDFs obtained for this setting to analyze the accuracy of our general, LED-based PDF equations.},

Following the method of Vuong (1989), a large sample Model Selection Test (MST), is introduced that can be used in conjunction with most existing MSC procedures to decide if the estimated goodness-of-fit for one model is significantly different from the estimated goodness-of-fit for another model. The MST extends the classical generalized likelihood ratio test, is valid in the presence of model misspecification, and is applicable to situations involving nonnested probability models. Simulation studies designed to illustrate the concept of the MST and its conservative decision rule (relative to the MSC method) are also presented. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

@article{Magner2011,
abstract = {Abstract: Control of non-point source (NPS) water pollution remains elusive in the United States (US). Many US water-bodies which have been primarily impacted by NPS pollution have not achieved water quality goals set by Clean Water Act. Technological advances have been made since 1972, yet many water resources fail to meet water quality standards. Common Pool Resources Theory is considered to understand the human dimension of NPS pollution by exploring anthropogenic activities superimposed upon dynamic ecosystems. In the final analysis, priority management zones (PMZs) for best management practice (BMP) implementation must have buy-in from land managers. TWAIM is an iterative systems thinking approach to planning, collecting landscape and land use information and communicating systems understanding to stakeholders. Hydrologic pathways that link the physical, chemical and biological characteristics influence processes occurring in a watershed which drive stream health and ecological function. With better systems understanding and application by technical specialists, there is potential for improved stakeholder interaction and dialogue which could then enable better land use decisions. Issues of pollutant origin, transport, storage and hydraulic residence must be defined and communicated effectively to land managers within a watershed context to observe trends in water quality change. The TWAIM concept provides a logical framework for locally-led assessment and a means to communicate ecohydrologic systems understanding over time to the key land managers such that PMZs can be defined for BMP implementation.},

@article{Fritz2006,
abstract = {While other research has reported on the concentrations of (129)I in the environment surrounding active nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities, there is a shortage of information regarding how the concentrations change once facilities close. At the Hanford Site, the Plutonium-Uranium Extraction (PUREX) chemical separation plant was operating between 1983 and 1990, during which time (129)I concentrations in air and milk were measured. After the cessation of chemical processing, plant emissions decreased 2.5 orders of magnitude over an 8-year period. An evaluation of (129)I and (127)I concentration data in air and milk spanning the PUREX operation and post-closure period was conducted to compare the changes in environmental levels. Measured concentrations over the monitoring period were below the levels that could result in a potential annual human dose greater than 1 mSv. There was a measurable difference in the measured air concentrations of (129)I at different distances from the source, indicating a distinct Hanford fingerprint. Correlations between stack emissions of (129)I and concentrations in air and milk indicate that atmospheric emissions were the major source of (129)I measured in environmental samples. The measured concentrations during PUREX operations were similar to observations made around a fuel reprocessing plant in Germany. After the PUREX Plant stopped operating, (129)I concentration measurements made upwind of Hanford were similar to the results from Seville, Spain.},

This series in Advances in Physiology Education provides an opportunity to do just that: we will investigate basic concepts in statistics using the free software package R. Because this series uses R solely as a vehicle with which to explore basic concepts in statistics, I provide the requisite R commands. In this inaugural paper we explore the essential distinction between standard deviation and standard error: a standard deviation estimates the variability among sample observations whereas a standard error of the mean estimates the variability among theoretical sample means. If we fail to report the standard deviation, then we fail to fully report our data. Because it incorporates information about sample size, the standard error of the mean is a misguided estimate of variability among observations. Instead, the standard error of the mean provides an estimate of the uncertainty of the true value of the population mean.},

abstract = {A large reservoir of bioavailable nitrogen (up to approximately 10(4) kilograms of nitrogen per hectare, as nitrate) has been previously overlooked in studies of global nitrogen distribution. The reservoir has been accumulating in subsoil zones of arid regions throughout the Holocene. Consideration of the subsoil reservoir raises estimates of vadose-zone nitrogen inventories by 14 to 71\% for warm deserts and arid shrublands worldwide and by 3 to 16\% globally. Subsoil nitrate accumulation indicates long-term leaching from desert soils, impelling further evaluation of nutrient dynamics in xeric ecosystems. Evidence that subsoil accumulations are readily mobilized raises concern about groundwater contamination after land-use or climate change.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to formalize the generalization criterion method for model comparison. The method has the potential to provide powerful comparisons of complex and nonnested models that may also differ in terms of numbers of parameters. The generalization criterion differs from the better known cross-validation criterion in the following critical procedure. Although both employ a calibration stage to estimate parameters, cross-validation employs a replication sample from the same design for the validation stage, whereas generalization employs a new design for the critical stage. Two examples of the generalization criterion method are presented that demonstrate its usefulness for selecting a model based on sound scientific principles out of a set that also contains models lacking sound scientific principles that are either overly complex or oversimplified. The main advantage of the generalization criterion is its reliance on extrapolations to new conditions. After all, accurate a priori predictions to new conditions are the hallmark of a good scientific theory. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

@article{Mathias2008,
abstract = {Due to its long radioactive half-life, iodine-129 is considered to be an important radionuclide in the context of underground radioactive waste disposal safety assessment. Iodine speciates as iodide (I-) in reducing conditions and iodate (IO3-) in oxidizing conditions. As iodate is more reactive, it is much less mobile than iodide. Consequently, in considering vertically upward transport within a soil profile, iodine will tend to accumulate at the top of the capillary fringe. In this paper, a model of iodine transport across a capillary fringe is developed by coupling equations for variably saturated flow, oxygen dynamics and rate-limited sorption. Model parameters are obtained by consideration of literature values, calibration on soil column data and other supporting laboratory experiments. The results demonstrate the importance of rate kinetics on the migration and bioavailability of radioiodine in the near-surface environment.},

@article{Morrill2005,
abstract = {Stable isotope analysis of chlorinated ethene contaminants was carried out during a bioaugmentation pilot test at Kelly Air Force Base (AFB) in San Antonio Texas. In this pilot test, cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) was the primary volatile organic compound. A mixed microbial enrichment culture, KB-1, shown in laboratory experiments to reduce chlorinated ethenes to non-toxic ethene, was added to the pilot test area. Following bioaugmentation with KB-1, perchloroethene (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE) and cDCE concentrations declined, while vinyl chloride (VC) concentrations increased and subsequently decreased as ethene became the dominant transformation product. Shifts in carbon isotopic values up to 2.7 per thousand, 6.4 per thousand, 10.9 per thousand and 10.6 per thousand were observed for PCE, TCE, cDCE and VC, respectively, after bioaugmentation, consistent with the effects of biodegradation. While a rising trend of VC concentrations and the first appearance of ethene were indicative of biodegradation by 72 days post-bioaugmentation, the most compelling evidence of biodegradation was the substantial carbon isotope enrichment (2.0 per thousand to 5.0 per thousand) in \"{a}13C(cDCE). Fractionation factors obtained in previous laboratory studies were used with isotope field measurements to estimate first-order cDCE degradation rate constants of 0.12 h(-1) and 0.17 h(-1) at 115 days post-bioaugmentation. These isotope-derived rate constants were clearly lower than, but within a factor of 2-4 of the previously published rate constant calculated in a parallel study at Kelly AFB using chlorinated ethene concentrations. Stable carbon isotopes can provide not only a sensitive means for early identification of the effects of biodegradation, but an additional means to quantify the rates of biodegradation in the field.},

One popular and effective approach for addressing such difficulties is to capture successful solutions in design patterns, abstract descriptions of interacting software components that can be customized to solve design problems within a particular context. Based upon a review of existing frameworks and our own experiences building visualization software, we present a series of design patterns for the domain of information visualization. We discuss the structure, context of use, and interrelations of patterns spanning data representation, graphics, and interaction. By representing design knowledge in a reusable form, these patterns can be used to facilitate software design, implementation, and evaluation, and improve developer education and communication.},

abstract = {Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark-recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible.},

abstract = {This chapter focuses on how land can be harmed by human activities, such as construction, agriculture, and transportation. These and other human activities lead to the release of chemical contaminants, but they also result in landscape damage, such as soil erosion, habitat destruction, and loss of resources, such as wetlands and coastal ecosystems. Plans must include measures to complement the natural and cultural environment and to avoid destruction or adverse alteration of the land. This means that good practice should always consider approaches to minimize impacts of construction, development, and facility operation on the surrounding watershed, by preventing water pollution and actions that disrupt natural drainage patterns. In addition, land use planning must directly address habitat destruction by recommending ways that any development conserve land that serves as habitat for native flora and fauna, both on- and off-site, and directly and indirectly. Another special consideration for land development is the presence of threatened or endangered species and the potential that their habitats may be affected by developing a site. Wasting land by losing it through erosion, diminishing its beneficial uses, and contaminating it is wholly unacceptable. Protecting land relies on sound application of not only the physical and natural sciences but also the social sciences. Where people choose to live is based on environmental quality and sociological and psychological factors. Land use planners, engineers, and waste managers each have vital roles in preventing and addressing land pollution.},

abstract = {Long-term field experiments have been carried out in the Chernobyl exclusion zone in order to determine the parameters governing radiochlorine (36Cl) transfer to plants from four types of soil, namely, podzoluvisol, greyzem, and typical and meadow chernozem. Radiochlorine concentration ratios (CR) in radish roots (15+/-10), lettuce leaves (30+/-15), bean pods (15+/-11) and wheat seed (23+/-11) and straw (210+/-110) for fresh weight of plants were obtained. These values correlate well with stable chlorine values for the same plants. One year after injection, 36Cl reached a quasi-equilibrium with stable chlorine in the agricultural soils and its behavior in the soil-plant system mimicked the behavior of stable chlorine (this behavior was determined by soil moisture transport in the investigated soils). In the absence of intensive vertical migration, more than half of 36Cl activity in arable layer of soil passes into the radish, lettuce and the aboveground parts of wheat during a single vegetation period.},

abstract = {Monitored natural attenuation (MNA) has recently emerged as a viable groundwater remediation technology in the United States. Area 6 at Dover Air Force Base (Dover, DE) was chosen as a test site to examine the potential for MNA of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) in groundwater and aquifer sediments. A "lines of evidence" approach was used to document the occurrence of natural attenuation. Chlorinated hydrocarbon and biogeochemical data were used to develop a site-specific conceptual model where both anaerobic and aerobic biological processes are responsible for the destruction of PCE, TCE, and daughter metabolites. An examination of groundwater biogeochemical data showed a region of depleted dissolved oxygen with elevated dissolved methane and hydrogen concentrations. Reductive dechlorination likely dominated in the anaerobic portion of the aquifer where PCE and TCE levels were observed to decrease with a simultaneous increase in cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-DCE), vinyl chloride (VC), ethene, and dissolved chloride. Near the anaerobic/ aerobic interface, concentrations of cis-DCE and VC decreased to below detection limits, presumably due to aerobic biotransformation processes. Therefore, the contaminant and daughter product plumes present at the site appear to have been naturally atteuated by a combination of active anaerobic and aerobic biotransformation processes.},

abstract = {Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management is dynamic, especially in evolving technology and policy changes. This chapter incorporates the basic issues, such as waste generation and composition, treatment and disposal, including illegal dumping, as well as, the challenges and issues of MSW management. Current topics of relevance, included in the chapter, are waste management and climate change, which explains the need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from this sector. Also important is marine pollution by MSW and its impact on marine life around small island nations. Lastly, an explicit discussion on the policy and regulations is elucidated to explore the main causes of the MSW management challenges, particularly in developing and transitory nations.
Municipal solid waste (MSW) is an inevitable by-product of human activity. It includes all wastes generated within a municipality. However, the definitions differ from country to country. In some developing nations, industrial waste and fecal material, though normally not considered as part of MSW, are often found in MSW and, thus, disposed together in normal landfills. MSW refers to all wastes generated, collected, transported, and disposed of within the jurisdiction of a municipal authority. In most cases, it comprises mainly food waste, and rubbish from residential areas, street sweepings, commercial and institutional nonhazardous wastes as well as (in some countries) construction and demolition waste. MSW management incorporates several interrelated aspects, which needs complete cooperation and collaboration for efficient delivery. It comprises aspects of waste generation, waste composition, collection, recycling (if any), pretreatment and treatment, and finally, disposal. These management aspects thus require input from legal, economic, governmental, political, administrative, and environmental players. Thus, it requires the involvement of multiprofessional drivers, and at times, the failure of one component is sufficient to cause the whole management to collapse. The management structure and function is site-specific and depends on socioeconomic, behavioral, cultural, institutional, and political frameworks. These stakeholders need to interact and cooperate for the management system to achieve its target.},

abstract = {Laboratory experiments were conducted to assess microbial reductive dechlorination in one-dimensional sand columns containing a 10 cm long source zone of uniformly distributed residual tetrachloroethene (PCE) nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL), a 10 cm long transition zone directly down-gradient of the source zone containing some nonuniformly distributed NAPL ganglia, and a 40 cm long plume region down-gradient of the transition zone. The activity and distribution of Sulfurospirillum multivorans, a PCE-to-1,2-cis-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) dechlorinating bacterium, was evaluated in columns containing either a mixed-NAPL (0.25 mol/mol PCE in hexadecane) or pure PCE-NAPL. Significant dechlorination of PCE to cis-DCE was observed in the mixed-NAPL column, resulting in 53\% PCE-NAPL mass recovery in the effluent with PCE-NAPL dissolution enhanced by up to 13.6-fold (maximum) and 4.6-fold (cumulative) relative to abiotic dissolution. Quantitative real-time PCR targeting pceA, the PCE reductive dehalogenase gene of S. multivorans, revealed that S. multivorans cells were present in the NAPL source zone, and increased in numbers (i.e., grew) throughout the source and transition zones. In contrast, minimal reductive dechlorination and microbial growth were observed in the column containing pure PCE-NAPL, where aqueous-phase PCE concentrations reached saturation. These results demonstrate that microbial growth within NAPL source zones is possible, provided that contaminant concentrations remain below levels toxic to the dechlorinating organisms, and that microbial growth can result in significant bioenhanced NAPL dissolution.},

abstract = {This study evaluates alternative groundwater models with different recharge and geologic components at the northern Yucca Flat area of the Death Valley Regional Flow System (DVRFS), USA. Recharge over the DVRFS has been estimated using five methods, and five geological interpretations are available at the northern Yucca Flat area. Combining the recharge and geological components together with additional modeling components that represent other hydrogeological conditions yields a total of 25 groundwater flow models. As all the models are plausible given available data and information, evaluating model uncertainty becomes inevitable. On the other hand, hydraulic parameters (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) are uncertain in each model, giving rise to parametric uncertainty. Propagation of the uncertainty in the models and model parameters through groundwater modeling causes predictive uncertainty in model predictions (e.g., hydraulic head and flow). Parametric uncertainty within each model is assessed using Monte Carlo simulation, and model uncertainty is evaluated using the model averaging method. Two model-averaging techniques (on the basis of information criteria and GLUE) are discussed. This study shows that contribution of model uncertainty to predictive uncertainty is significantly larger than that of parametric uncertainty. For the recharge and geological components, uncertainty in the geological interpretations has more significant effect on model predictions than uncertainty in the recharge estimates. In addition, weighted residuals vary more for the different geological models than for different recharge models. Most of the calibrated observations are not important for discriminating between the alternative models, because their weighted residuals vary only slightly from one model to another.},

abstract = {Risk is a common metric for waste management. Societal expectations of acceptable risk are mandated by the standards and specifications of certifying authorities. Articulating the hazard (the agent of harm) is matched against the ways that people or other receptors may come into contact with that hazard, that is, exposure. Thus, risk management includes the policies, laws, and other societal endeavors that limit these two components of risk. From the hazard perspectives, regulatory agencies may decide that a product is too hazardous when it is manufactured, used, or when it becomes a waste product. Thus, the hazard may occur before a waste is generated, such as a component of a manufacturing process. Waste management success is a function of the amount of risk that has been reduced or avoided. Thus, the success of all waste operations is, to some extent, a reflection of the operation's hazards and potential exposures to these hazards. Decisions must be based on scientifically credible information. This information is part of the risk assessment that informs waste management decisions.},

This work presents an overview on sources of anthropogenic radionuclides in the environment, as well as a brief discussion of salient geochemical behavior of important radionuclides. We first discuss the following major anthropogenic sources and current developments that have lead, or could potentially contribute, to the radionuclide contamination of the environment: (1) nuclear weapons program; (2) nuclear weapons testing; (3) nuclear power plants; (4) uranium mining and milling; (5) commercial fuel reprocessing; (6) geological repository of high-level nuclear wastes that include radionuclides might be released in the future, and (7) nuclear accidents. Then, we briefly summarize the inventory of radionuclides (99)Tc and (129)I, as well as geochemical behavior for radionuclides (99)Tc, (129)I, and (237)Np, because of their complex geochemical behavior, long half-lives, and presumably high mobility in the environment; biogeochemical cycling and environment risk assessment must take into account speciation of these redox-sensitive radionuclides.},

A typical PRA starts by identifying relevant components of a system (e.g. ventilation system components, potential sources of contaminants, remediation methods) and proceeds by using available information and statistical inference to estimate the probabilities of their failure. These probabilities are then combined by means of fault-tree analyses to yield probabilistic estimates of the risk of system failure (e.g. building contamination). A sensitivity study of PRAs can identify features and potential problems that need to be addressed with the most urgency. Often PRAs are amenable to approximations, which can significantly simplify the approach. All these features of PRA are presented in this paper via a simple illustrative example, which can be built upon in further studies. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The tool presented here can be used to design and maintain adequate ventilation systems to minimize exposure of occupants to contaminants.},

@article{Weatherill2006,
abstract = {Applied tracer tests provide a means to estimate aquifer parameters in fractured rock. The traditional approach to analysing these tests has been using a single fracture model to find the parameter values that generate the best fit to the measured breakthrough curve. In many cases, the ultimate aim is to predict solute transport under the natural gradient. Usually, no confidence limits are placed on parameter values and the impact of parameter errors on predictions of solute transport is not discussed. The assumption inherent in this approach is that the parameters determined under forced conditions will enable prediction of solute transport under the natural gradient. This paper considers the parameter and prediction uncertainty that might arise from analysis of breakthrough curves obtained from forced gradient applied tracer tests. By adding noise to an exact solution for transport in a single fracture in a porous matrix we create multiple realisations of an initial breakthrough curve. A least squares fitting routine is used to obtain a fit to each realisation, yielding a range of parameter values rather than a single set of absolute values. The suite of parameters is then used to make predictions of solute transport under lower hydraulic gradients and the uncertainty of estimated parameters and subsequent predictions of solute transport is compared. The results of this study show that predictions of breakthrough curve characteristics (first inflection point time, peak arrival time and peak concentration) for groundwater flow speeds with orders of magnitude smaller than that at which a test is conducted can sometimes be determined even more accurately than the fracture and matrix parameters.},

abstract = {In a world of supercomputers, genetic engineering, and fiber optics, technological creativity is ever more the key to economic success. But why are some nations more creative than others, and why do some highly innovative societies--such as ancient China, or Britain in the industrial revolution--pass into stagnation? Beginning with a fascinating, concise history of technological progress, Mokyr sets the background for his analysis by tracing the major inventions and innovations that have transformed society since ancient Greece and Rome. What emerges from this survey is often surprising: the classical world, for instance, was largely barren of new technology, the relatively backward society of medieval Europe bristled with inventions, and the period between the Reformation and the Industrial Revolution was one of slow and unspectacular progress in technology, despite the tumultuous developments associated with the Voyages of Discovery and the Scientific Revolution. What were the causes of technological creativity? Mokyr distinguishes between the relationship of inventors and their physical environment--which determined their willingness to challenge nature--and the social environment, which determined the openness to new ideas. He discusses a long list of such factors, showing how they interact to help or hinder a nation's creativity, and then illustrates them by a number of detailed studies taken from the history of Europe and China. He examines such aspects as the role of the state (the Chinese gave up a millenium-wide lead in shipping to the Europeans, for example, when an Emperor banned large ocean-going vessels), the impact of science, as well as religion, politics, and even nutrition. He questions the importance of such commonly-cited factors as the spill-over benefits of war, the abundance of of natural resources, life expectancy, and labor costs. And he presents startlingly novel explanations of why China lost its dramatic lead in technology to Europe, why medieval Europe was technologically more creative than Classical Antiquity, and why Britain left the rest of the world behind during the Industrial Revolution only to lose its leadership a century later. Today, an ever greater number of industrial economies are competing in the global market, locked in a struggle that revolves around technological ingenuity. Lever of Riches, with its keen analysis derived from a sweeping survey of creativity throughout history, offers telling insight into the question of how Western economies can maintain, and developing nations can unlock, their creative potential.},

abstract = {In this paper we briefly study the basic idea of Akaike's (1973) information criterion (AIC). Then, we present some recent developments on a new entropic or information complexity (ICOMP) criterion of Bozdogan (1988a, 1988b, 1990, 1994d, 1996, 1998a, 1998b) for model selection. A rationale for ICOMP as a model selection criterion is that it combines a badness-of-fit term (such as minus twice the maximum log likelihood) with a measure of complexity of a model differently than AIC, or its variants, by taking into account the interdependencies of the parameter estimates as well as the dependencies of the model residuals. We operationalize the general form of ICOMP based on the quantification of the concept of overall model complexity in terms of the estimated inverse-Fisher information matrix. This approach results in an approximation to the sum of two Kullback-Leibler distances. Using the correlational form of the complexity, we further provide yet another form of ICOMP to take into account the interdependencies (i.e., correlations) among the parameter estimates of the model. Later, we illustrate the practical utility and the importance of this new model selection criterion by providing several real as well as Monte Carlo simulation examples and compare its performance against AIC, or its variants.

abstract = {Experiments have become an increasingly common tool for political science researchers over the last decade, particularly laboratory experiments performed on small convenience samples. The standard statistical paradigm used in political science is designed to connect samples to populations, while the inferential goal in an experiment is often about understand- ing whether an observed treatment effect occurred due to chance. In this paper, we outline an alternative derivation for statistical inference based on randomization of the treatment. While some standard tests approximate this form of inference, many do not and can produce incorrect inferences. These tests also have robust forms that are insensitive to the distribu- tion of the data. We outline common randomization tests, such as Wilcoxon rank tests and the Kruskal-Wallis test, and also develop a randomization test for two-way factorial designs as an alternative to the commonly used two-way ANOVA model. Finally, we reanalyze data from two political science experiments using randomization tests to illustrate the inferential errors that can be made when classical tests are used with data from the lab.},

abstract = {Multiplicative interaction models are common in the quantitative political science literature. This is so for good reason. Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although con- ditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don’ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article. Only 10\% of the articles in our survey followed the checklist.},

As a consequence, they miss opportunities to present quantities that are of greatest substantive interest for their research and express the appropriate degree of certainty about these quantities. In this article, we offer an approach, built on the technique of statistical simulation, to extract the currently overlooked information from any statistical method and to interpret and present it in a reader-friendly manner. Using this technique requires some expertise, which we try to provide herein, but its application should make the results of quantitative articles more informative and transparent. To illustrate our recommendations, we replicate the results of several published works, showing in each case how the authors’ own conclusions can be expressed more sharply and informatively, and, without changing any data or statistical assumptions, how our approach reveals important new information about the research questions at hand. We also offer very easy-to-use software that implements our suggestions.},

abstract = {Used to estimate the risk of an estimator or to perform model selection, cross-validation is a widespread strategy because of its simplicity and its apparent universality. Many results exist on the model selection performances of cross-validation procedures. This survey intends to relate these results to the most recent advances of model selection theory, with a particular emphasis on distinguishing empirical statements from rigorous theoretical results. As a conclusion, guidelines are provided for choosing the best cross-validation procedure according to the particular features of the problem in hand.},

@unpublished{Imai2009,
abstract = {In a highly influential paper, Baron and Kenny (1986) proposed a statistical procedure to con- duct a causal mediation analysis and identify possible causal mechanisms. This procedure has been widely used across many branches of the social and medical sciences and especially in psychology and epidemiology. However, one major limitation of this approach is that it is based on a set of linear regressions and cannot be easily extended to more complex situations that are frequently encoun- tered in applied research. In this paper, we propose an approach that generalizes the Baron-Kenny procedure. Our method can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and non- parametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. We also provide a formal statistical justification for the proposed generalization of the Baron-Kenny pro- cedure by placing causal mediation analysis within the widely-accepted counterfactual framework of causal inference. Finally, we develop a set of sensitivity analyses that allow applied researchers to quantify the robustness of their empirical conclusions. Such sensitivity analysis is important because as we showthe Baron-Kenny procedure and our generalization of it rest on a strong and untestable as- sumption even in randomized experiments. We illustrate the proposed methods by applying them to a randomized field experiment, the Job Search Intervention Study (JOBS II).We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all of our proposed methods.},

@article{Schwartz2011,
abstract = {Patterns of interaction in any social system are accompanied by counter-patterns of withdrawal, one highly institutionalized (but unexplored) mode of which is privacy. There exists a threshold beyond which social contact becomes irritating for all parties; therefore, some provision for removing oneself from interaction and observation must be built into every establishment. Such provisions subserve the action patterns for which they provide intermission. Privacy, which is bought and sold in social establishments, reflects and affirms status divisions, and permits "localized" deviation which is invisible to the group as a whole. Privacy thereby unsulates against dysfunctional knowledge. Rules governing entrance into and exit from privacy are most clearly articulated on the level of the establishment and are reflected in its physical structure and in proprieties concerning the uses of space, doors, windows, drawers, etc. The report ends with a discussion of identity and its relation to the freedoms of engagement and disengagement.},

Through algebraic and interpretive proofs, some of the most commonly made mistakes are explicated and illus- trated. The theoretical problem underlying each is highlighted, and suggested solutions are provided throughout. It is argued that closer attention to these problems and solutions will result in more reliable quantitative analyses and more useful theoretical contributions.},

@unpublished{Franzese2001,
abstract = {Despite occasional constructive pedagogical treatises on the topic in the past (e.g., Friedrich 1982), a common methodology for employing and interpreting interaction terms in regression analysis continues to elude the field; and, partly as a consequence, their misinterpretation remains sadly rampant. This paper aims to redress these problems. We first document the widespread and expanding use of interaction terms in political science. We then elaborate and support our claim that, despite the increased use of interaction terms in regression analyses, many inherently interactive arguments are not being modeled as such. Finally, we note and review several inconsistencies and much confusion in the literature regarding the substantive interpretation of interaction terms and the statistical inferences from the coefficient and standard-error estimates surrounding them. After this review, we discuss three pedagogical themes. First, we offer a generic consideration of the process of writing empirical models that embody interactive hypotheses. Our second theme focuses more specifically on a set of statistical practices and rules of thumb when utilizing interaction models suggested by previous methodological treatments of the topic and frequently employed in current political science literature. We demonstrate that many of these can be misleading. Finally, we discuss the presentation of interaction effects. We show that, while the existing practice of reporting standard errors for individual coefficients remains useful, that practice is decidedly insufficient regarding coefficients on interactive terms. Assessment of interaction effects virtually requires graphical or tabular presentation of results, neither of which is currently commonly published. In this context, we strongly suggest the use of effect-line graphs or conditional-coefficient tables, complete with standard errors, hypothesis tests, and/or confidence intervals of those effects or conditional coefficients. We show how to construct these graphs and tables, giving detailed spreadsheet formulae for doing so in addition to the standard mathematical formulae for their elements.},

@article{Szalkai2013,
abstract = {The original k-means clustering method works only if the exact vectors representing the data points are known. Therefore calculating the distances from the centroids needs vector operations, since the average of abstract data points is undefined. Existing algorithms can be extended for those cases when the sole input is the distance matrix, and the exact representing vectors are unknown. This extension may be named relational k-means after a notation for a similar algorithm invented for fuzzy clustering. A method is then proposed for generalizing k-means for scenarios when the data points have absolutely no connection with a Euclidean space.},

We also survey recently proposed strategies for modeling ordinal response variables when the data have some type of clustering or when repeated measurement occurs at various occasions for each subject, such as in longitudinal studies. Primary models in that case include marginal models and cluster-specific (conditional) models for which effects apply conditionally at the cluster level. Re- lated discussion refers to multi-level and transitional models. The main empha- sis is on maximum likelihood inference, although we indicate certain models (e.g., marginal models,multi-level models) for which this can be computationally difficult. The Bayesian approach has also received considerable attention for categorical data in the past decade, and we survey recent Bayesian approaches to modeling ordinal response variables. Alternative, non-model-based, approaches are also available for certain types of inference.},
