@article{Horton1971,
abstract = {Equations describing the loss of HTO from water into air and the gain of HTO in water when the overlying water vapor contains tritium but the solution does not are developed and verified by laboratory experiments. Results show that under environmental conditions, where the relative humidity is greater than 8\%, HTO is lost preferentially over HzO to the atmosphere because atmospheric moisture is virtually free of HTO. Results from a three-year study of the changes in tri- tium content of a large nonseeping outdoor basin are used to extend the laboratory studies to field situations. Data from this field study were used to calculate tritium loss from open basins. These calculations show, for example, that 90\% of the tritium contained in an aqueous stream flowing at 15,000 liters per day will be lost to the atmosphere from a shallow basin with a surface area of 6000 m.},
