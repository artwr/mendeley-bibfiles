abstract = {Transport and degradation of de-icing chemical (containing propylene glycol, PG) in the vadose zone were studied with a lysimeter experiment and a model, in which transient water flow, kinetic degradation of PG and soil chemistry were combined. The lysimeter experiment indicated that aerobic as well as anaerobic degradation occurs in the vadose zone. Therefore, the model included both types of degradation, which was made possible by assuming advection-controlled (mobile) and diffusion-controlled (immobile) zones. In the mobile zone, oxygen can be transported by diffusion in the gas phase. The immobile zone is always water-saturated, and oxygen only diffuses slowly in the water phase. Therefore, the model is designed in a way that the redox potential can decrease when PG is degraded, and thus, anaerobic degradation can occur. In our model, manganese oxide (MnO2, which is present in the soil) and NO 3 − −3\_\{3\}\^{}\{-\} (applied to enhance biodegradation) can be used as electron acceptors for anaerobic degradation. The application of NO 3 − −3\_\{3\}\^{}\{-\} does not result in a lower leaching of PG nor in a slower depletion of MnO2. The thickness of the snowcover influences the leached fraction of PG, as with a high infiltration rate, transport is fast, there is less time for degradation and thus more PG will leach. The model showed that, in this soil, the effect of the water flow dominates over the effect of the degradation parameters on the leaching at a 1-m depth.},

abstract = {Non-Fickian transport ubiquitously occurs across all scales within fractured geological media. Detailed characterization of non-Fickian transport through single fractures is thus critical for predicting the fate of solutes and other fluid-borne entities through fractured media. Our direct numerical simulations of solute transport through two-dimensional rough-walled fractures showed early arrival and heavy tailing in breakthrough curves (BTCs), which are salient characteristics of non-Fickian transport. Analyses for dispersion coefficients (DADE) using the standard advection-dispersion equation (ADE) led to errors which increased linearly with fracture heterogeneity. Estimated Taylor dispersion coefficients deviated from estimated DADE even at higher Peclet numbers. Alternatively, we used continuous time random walk (CTRW) model with truncated power law transition rate probability to characterize the non-Fickian transport. CTRW modeling markedly and consistently improved fits to the BTCs relative to those fitted with ADE solutions. The degree of deviation of transport from Fickian to non-Fickian is captured by the parameter $\beta$ of the truncated power law. We found that $\beta$ is proportional to fracture heterogeneity. We also found that the CTRW transport velocity can be predicted based on the flow velocity. Along with the ability to predict $\beta$, this is a major step towards prediction of transport through CTRW using measurable physical properties.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT 129I is commonly either the top or among the top risk drivers, along with 99Tc, at radiological waste disposal sites and contaminated groundwater sites where nuclear material fabrication or reprocessing has occurred. The risk stems largely from 129I having a high toxicity, a high bioaccumulation factor (90\% of all the body's iodine concentrates in the thyroid), a high inventory at source terms (due to its high fission yield), an extremely long half-life (16M yr), and rapid mobility in the subsurface environment. Another important reason that 129I is a key risk driver is that there is the uncertainty regarding its biogeochemical fate and transport in the environment. We typically can define 129I mass balance and flux at sites, but cannot predict accurately its response to changes in the environment. As a consequence of some of these characteristics, 129I has a very low Drinking Water Standard, DWS, which is set at 1 pCi/L, the lowest of all radionuclides in the Federal Register. Recently, significant advancements have been made in detecting iodine species at ambient groundwater concentrations, defining the nature of the organic matter and iodine bond, and quantifying the role of naturally occurring sediment microbes to promote iodine oxidation and reduction. These recent studies have led to a more mechanistic understanding of radioiodine biogeochemistry. The objective of this review is to describe these advances and to provide a state of the science of radioiodine biogeochemistry relevant to its fate and transport in the terrestrial environment and provide information useful for making decisions regarding the stewardship and remediation of 129I contaminated sites. As part of this review, knowledge gaps were identified that would significantly advance the goals of basic and applied research programs for accelerating 129I environmental remediation and reducing uncertainty associated with disposal of 129I waste. Together the information gained from addressing these knowledge gaps will not alter the observation that 129I is primarily mobile, but it will likely permit demonstration that the entire 129I pool in the source term is not moving at the same rate and some may be tightly bound to the sediment, thereby “smearing” the modeled 129I peak and reducing maximum calculated risk.},

abstract = {Radionuclides emitted from the Fukushima I nuclear power plant have been detected in air all over Europe. Concentrations remained far below levels which could have caused radiological concern: probably the committed thyroid dose due to inhalation remained below about 1 $\mu$Sv (for 10 y children), within the investigated region. They provided, however, a spatio-temporal signal which could be used to develop and test tools to provide additional information on the large-scale situation (Europe-wide, in this case) during a nuclear emergency.
In this part we discuss the spatial distribution of the contaminated air masses over Europe. Using 131I as an example, we present a method to construct maps of the time-cumulated 131I concentration in air and of the peak concentrations. Procedures to deal with the statistical limitations of a data set stemming from different monitoring schemes are discussed. As over all results, the mean (over the investigated region) cumulated concentration of particular 131I is estimated about 9 mBq d/m3, with observed maximum of about 23 mBq d/m3. The probability that much higher concentrations occurred at unsampled locations, than have been observed anywhere, is assessed low, e.g. about 2.5\% for the cumulated 131I(part.) concentration to exceed 30 mBq d/m3.
Our method can be used in nuclear emergencies for providing spatial analyses if radionuclide concentrations of health concern are detected by atmospheric monitoring stations. We suggest considering such methods of data harmonization if synoptic assessment based on heterogeneous datasets is attempted.},

abstract = {The paper presents a new multi-step approach aiming at source identification and release history estimation. The new approach consists of three steps: performing integral pumping tests, identifying sources, and recovering the release history by means of a geostatistical approach. The present paper shows the results obtained from the application of the approach within a complex case study in Poland in which several areal sources were identified. The investigated site is situated in the vicinity of a former chemical plant in southern Poland in the city of Jaworzno in the valley of the Wąwolnica River; the plant has been in operation since the First World War producing various chemicals. From an environmental point of view the most relevant activity was production of pesticides, especially lindane. The application of the multi-step approach enabled a significant increase in the knowledge of contamination at the site. Some suspected contamination sources have been proven to have minor effect on the overall contamination. Other suspected sources have been proven to have key significance. Some areas not taken into consideration previously have now been identified as key sources. The method also enabled estimation of the magnitude of the sources and, a list of the priority reclamation actions will be drawn as a result. The multi-step approach has proven to be effective and may be applied to other complicated contamination cases. Moreover, the paper shows the capability of the geostatistical approach to manage a complex real case study.},

abstract = {The migration of a contaminant from a zone of injection disposal of hazardous liquid waste in a deep-seated aquifer is considered. Because of its higher density, the polluted groundwater will accumulate under the effect of gravity in aquifer dips (depressions). A 2D-model of variable-density groundwater flow is used to determine the conditions under which the gravity force will prevent polluted groundwater from leaving depressions driven by regional current. As the result, such depressions can serve as natural traps for polluted waters. The required conditions are based on simple analytical relationships, derived from the analysis of a theoretical model of variable-density groundwater flow in an inclined confined aquifer. The obtained technique is used to estimate the efficiency of such a trap at the site of injection disposal of liquid radioactive waste from Mining and Chemical Combine in Krasnoyarsk region. The analytical estimates of the trap with the use of the proposed technique are shown to be in good agreement with the results of numerical simulation of contaminant migration.},

abstract = {The history and fate of groundwater nitrate (NO3−) contamination were compared in 2 small adjacent agricultural watersheds in the Atlantic coastal plain by combined use of chronologic (CCl2F2, 3H), chemical (dissolved solids, gases), and isotopic ($\delta$15N,$\delta$13C, $\delta$34S) analyses of recharging groundwaters, discharging groundwaters, and surface waters. The results demonstrate the interactive effects of changing agricultural practices, groundwater residence times, and local geologic features on the transfer of NO3− through local flow systems. Recharge dates of groundwaters taken in 1990–1992 from the surficial aquifer in the Chesterville Branch and Morgan Creek watersheds near Locust Grove, Maryland, ranged from pre-1940 to the late 1980’s. When corrected for localized denitrification by use of dissolved gas concentrations, the dated waters provide a 40-year record of the recharge rate of NO3−, which increased in both watersheds by a factor of 3–6, most rapidly in the 1970's. The increase in groundwater NO3− over time was approximately proportional to the documented increase in regional N fertilizer use, and could be accounted for by oxidation and leaching of about 20–35\% of the fertilizer N. Groundwaters discharging upward beneath streams in both watersheds had measured recharge dates from pre-1940 to 1975, while chemical data for second-order reaches of the streams indicated average groundwater residence times in the order of 20+ years. At the time of the study, NO3− discharge rates were less than NO3− recharge rates for at least two reasons: (1) discharge of relatively old waters with low initial NO3− concentrations, and (2) local denitrification. In the Chesterville Branch watershed, groundwaters remained oxic throughout much of the surficial aquifer and discharged relatively unaltered to the stream, which had a relatively high NO3− concentration (9–10 mg/L as N). In the Morgan Creek watershed, groundwaters were largely reduced and denitrified before discharging to the stream, which had a relatively low NO3− concentration (2–3 mg/L as N). Chemical and isotopic data indicate that quantitative denitrification occurred within buried calcareous glauconitic marine sediments that are present at relatively shallow depths beneath the Morgan Creek watershed. NO3− removal by forests, wetlands, and shallow organic-rich soils in near-stream environments was largely avoided by groundwaters that followed relatively deep flow paths before converging and discharging rapidly upward to the streams.},

In Part I of this two-part article, we derive a closed-form analytical solution to this problem for spatially-varying initial conditions. The proposed solution procedure employs a combination of Laplace and linear transform methods to uncouple and solve the system of partial differential equations. Two distinct solutions are derived for Dirichlet and Cauchy boundary conditions each with Bateman-type source terms. We organize and present the final solutions in a common format that represents the solutions to both boundary conditions. In addition, we provide the mathematical concepts for deriving the solution within a generic framework that can be used for solving similar transport problems.},

abstract = {Stochastic analyses were performed to examine sequential first-order monomolecular reactions at the microscopic scale and both Fickian and non-Fickian plume reactive transport at the macroscopic scale. An analytical solution was derived for the chemical master equation (CME) for a closed system of irreversible first-order monomolecular reactions. Taking a Lagrangian reference frame of particles migrating from a source, analyses show that the relative concentration of each species in the deterministic analytical solution for 1-D steady-state plug flow with first-order sequential degradation is mathematically equivalent to the mean of a multinomial distribution of plume particles moving at constant velocity with sequential transformations described by transition probabilities of a discrete state, continuous-time Markov chain. In order to examine the coupling of reaction and transport terms in subdiffusive-reactive transport equations, a closed-form multi-species analytical solution also was derived for steady-state advection, dispersion, and sequential first-order reaction. Using a 1-D continuous time random walk (CTRW) embedded in Markov chains, computationally efficient Monte Carlo simulations of particle movement were performed to more fully examine effects of subdiffusive- reactive transport with an application to steady-state, sequentially degrading multi-species plumes at a site in Palm, Bay, FL. The simulation results indicated that non-Fickian steady-state plumes can resemble Fickian plumes because linear reactions truncate the waiting time between particle jumps, which removes lower velocity particles from the broad spectrum of velocities in highly heterogeneous media. Results show that fitting of Fickian models to plume concentration data can lead to inaccurate estimates of rate constants because of the wide distribution of travel times in highly heterogeneous media.},

abstract = {Abstract This study introduces the dispersive fluid flux of total fluid mass to the density-driven flow equation to improve thermohaline modeling of salt and heat transports in porous media. The dispersive fluid flux in the flow equation is derived to account for an additional fluid flux driven by the density gradient and mechanical dispersion. The coupled flow, salt transport and heat transport governing equations are numerically solved by a fully implicit finite difference method to investigate solution changes due to the dispersive fluid flux. The numerical solutions are verified by the Henry problem and the thermal Elder problem under a moderate density effect and by the brine Elder problem under a strong density effect. It is found that increment of the maximum ratio of the dispersive fluid flux to the advective fluid flux results in increasing dispersivity for the Henry problem and the brine Elder problem. The effects of the dispersive fluid flux on salt and heat transports under high density differences and high dispersivities are more noticeable than under low density differences and low dispersivities. Values of quantitative indicators such as the Nusselt number, mass flux, salt mass stored and maximum penetration depth in the brine Elder problem show noticeable changes by the dispersive fluid flux. In the thermohaline Elder problem, the dispersive fluid flux shows a considerable effect on the shape and the number of developed fingers and makes either an upwelling or a downwelling flow in the center of the domain. In conclusion, for the general case that involves strong density-driven flow and transport modeling in porous media, the dispersive fluid flux should be considered in the flow equation.},

abstract = {Several numerical codes have been used to simulate radionuclide transport in fractured rock systems. The validation of such numerical codes can be accomplished by comparison of numerical simulations against appropriate analytical solutions. In this paper, we present analytical solutions for the reactive transport of N-member radionuclide chains (i.e., multiple species of radionuclides and their daughter species) through a discrete fracture in a porous rock matrix applying a system decomposition approach. We consider the transport of N-member radionuclide chains in a single-fracture–matrix system as a starting point to simulate more realistic and complex systems. The processes considered are advection along the fracture, lateral diffusion in the matrix, radioactive decay of multiple radionuclides, and adsorption in both the fracture and matrix. Different retardation factors can be specified for the fracture and matrix. However, all species are assumed to share the same retardation factors for the fracture and matrix, respectively. Although a daughter species may penetrate farther along the fracture than its parent species when a constant-concentration boundary condition is applied, our results indicate that all species retain the same transport speed in the fracture if a pulse of the first species is released into the fracture. This solution scheme provides a way to validate numerical computer codes of radionuclide transport in fractured rock, such as those being used to assess the performance of a potential nuclear-waste repository at Yucca Mountain.},

abstract = {Modeling the field scale movement of chemicals in unsaturated soil is of intense interest to both the public and private sectors and has become an area of active theoretical research in a number of environmentally based disciplines. However, the experimental data needed to validate existing solute transport models and to inspire the development of more refined approaches is very limited. In this research study, the movement of a mobile tracer (Br−) was monitored as it moved through the unsaturated zone beneath the soil surface of a 0.64 ha loamy sand field. Under flux-controlled, steady state water flow achieved by bidaily sprinkler irrigation, a narrow pulse of 58.9 mol/m−3 NaBr(aq) was applied uniformly to the field and subsequently leached downward while monitored by vacuum solution samplers replicated 16 times at each of 6 depths between 0.3 and 3.0 m and 6 times at the 4.5-m depth. Six deep soil cores to a maximum of 25 m were taken to characterize the final field average bromide depth profile after the pulse had passed the 4.5-m depth. Although the mass recovery of the area-averaged pulse was near 100\% at all depths, the coefficient of variation (CV) of mass recovery between samplers at a given depth was near 50\%. Lateral variations in apparent vertical solute velocity or in solute transport volume were considerable, with CVs near 50\% in the shallow monitoring depths. However, variations in transport volume with depth at a given site were also large, even though the solution samplers for different depths were displaced laterally by only 0.3–0.6 m at different sites. The mean vertical velocity of the area-averaged solute pulse was significantly less than the ratio of the average net water flux to the average volumetric water content, until approximately 1.8 m. The difference between the two average velocities near the surface was large enough (nearly a factor of 2) to suggest that transient effects from the bidaily irrigations were influencing solute transport.},

abstract = {We estimated the flux of caesium-137 adsorbed to suspended sediment in the Kusaki Dam reservoir in the Fukushima region of eastern Japan, which was contaminated by the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant accident. The amount and rate of reservoir sedimentation and the caesium-137 concentration were validated based on the mixed-particle distribution and a sediment transport equation. The caesium-137 and sediment flux data suggested that wash load, suspended load sediment, and caesium-137 were deposited and the discharge and transport processes generated acute pollution, especially during extreme rainfall-runoff events. Additionally, we qualitatively assessed future changes in caesium-137 and sediment fluxes in the reservoir. The higher deposition and discharge at the start of the projection compared to the 2090s are most likely explained by the radioactive decay of caesium-137 and the effects of reservoir sedimentation. Predictions of the impacts of future climate on sediment and caesium-137 fluxes are crucial for environmental planning and management.},

@article{Bons2013,
abstract = {Perturbations of temperature or solute concentration in a porous medium spread out by heat or molecular diffusion, respectively. If the pore-filling medium (e.g. water in soil) flows, this causes additional spreading of the perturbation due to the variation of local flow velocities and the tortuous flow lines through pore space. Together, this is termed dispersion, which plays an important role in geothermal energy production, contaminant transport and reactor beds. Numerous models have been proposed to describe the dispersion coefficient as a function of flow rates, diffusion rates and other parameters, such as pore geometry. These models are either for heat (thermal) or solute dispersion, and often only valid for a limited range of flow rates, typically expressed in terms of the P\'{e}clet number. Here we present a single, universal expression for both the heat and solute dispersion coefficient in homogeneous porous media, valid over a wide range of P\'{e}clet numbers. Only three parameters have to be determined, which depend mainly on the pore geometry of the material. The expression facilitates the physical understanding of dispersion and may be helpful for the interpretation of numerical microscopic modeling results. It has the practical advantage that the heat dispersion coefficient can easily be calculated from the solute dispersion coefficient (or vice versa) and that dispersion coefficients over a wide range of P\'{e}clet numbers can be estimated from measurements over only a limited range.},

abstract = {The environmental chemodynamics of hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs) are often rate-limited by diffusion in stagnant boundary layers. This study investigated whether motile microorganisms can act as microbial carriers that enhance mass transfer of HOCs through diffusive boundary layers. A new experimental system was developed that allows (1) generation of concentration gradients of HOCs under the microscope, (2) exposure and direct observation of microorganisms in such gradients and (3) quantification of HOC mass transfer. Silicone O-rings were integrated into a Dunn chemotaxis chamber to serve as sink and source for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This resulted in stable concentration gradients in water (> 24 h). Adding the model organism Tetrahymena pyriformis to the experimental system enhanced PAH mass transfer up to 100-fold (benzo[a]pyrene). Increasing mass transfer enhancement with hydrophobicity indicated PAH co-transport with the motile organisms. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed such transport. The effective diffusivity of T. pyriformis, determined by video imaging microscopy, was found to exceed molecular diffusivities of the PAHs up to four-fold. Cell-bound PAH fractions were determined to range from 28 \% (naphthalene) to 92 \% (pyrene). Motile microorganisms can therefore function as effective carriers for HOCs under diffusive conditions and might significantly enhance mobility and availability of HOCs.},

abstract = {Nitrate concentration in groundwater is influenced by complex and interrelated variables, leading to great difficulty during the modeling process. The objectives of this study are (1) to evaluate the performance of two artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, namely artificial neural networks and support vector machine, in modeling groundwater nitrate concentration using scant input data, as well as (2) to assess the effect of data clustering as a pre-modeling technique on the developed models' performance. The AI models were developed using data from 22 municipal wells of the Gaza coastal aquifer in Palestine from 2000 to 2010. Results indicated high simulation performance, with the correlation coefficient and the mean average percentage error of the best model reaching 0.996 and 7 \%, respectively. The variables that strongly influenced groundwater nitrate concentration were previous nitrate concentration, groundwater recharge, and on-ground nitrogen load of each land use land cover category in the well's vicinity. The results also demonstrated the merit of performing clustering of input data prior to the application of AI models. With their high performance and simplicity, the developed AI models can be effectively utilized to assess the effects of future management scenarios on groundwater nitrate concentration, leading to more reasonable groundwater resources management and decision-making},

Where only one or two distinct tracers are available, overprinting in the output concentrations limits the injection frequency. In this letter we propose an experimental method (the PERiodic Tracer Hierarchy - PERTH) that allows overprinted breakthrough curves to be decomposed into contributions from multiple injections of the same tracer,so long as the transporting flow is periodic. This method allows the time varying transit time distributions to be observed efficiently while making no a priori assumptions about the transport processes operating in the system. Simulations of transport through a soil column subject to a periodic sequence of irrigation events demonstrate that the distinct transit time distributions associated with each irrigation event can be retrieved almost exactly.},

abstract = {Developing a predictive understanding of subsurface contaminant plume evolution and natural attenuation capacity is hindered by the inability to tractably characterize controlling reactive transport properties over field-relevant scales. Here we explore a concept of reactive facies, which is based on the hypothesis that subsurface units exist that have unique distributions of properties that influence reactive transport. We further hypothesize that geophysical methods can be used to identify and spatially distribute reactive facies and their associated parameters. We test the reactive facies concept at a U.S. Department of Energy uranium-contaminated groundwater site, where we have analyzed the relationships between laboratory and field (including radar and seismic tomographic) data sets. Our analysis suggests that there are two reactive facies that have unique distributions of mineralogy, texture, hydraulic conductivity, and geophysical attributes. We use these correlations within a Bayesian framework to integrate the dense geophysical data sets with the sparse core-based measurements. This yields high-resolution (0.25 m × 0.25 m) estimates of reactive facies and their associated properties and uncertainties along the 2-D tomographic transects. Comparison with colocated samples shows that the estimated properties fall within 95\% uncertainty bounds. To illustrate the value of reactive facies characterization approach, we used the geophysically estimated properties to parameterize reactive transport models, which were then used to simulate migration of an acidic-U plume through the domain. Modeling results suggest that each identified reactive facies exerts a unique control on plume evolution, highlighting the usefulness of the reactive facies concept for spatially distributing properties that control reactive transport over field-relevant scales.},

The model framework employs a suite of flow, solute transport and reactive transport simulation tools, i.e., MODFLOW, MT3DMS, and PHT3D. On the basis of our model simulations, the collection-trench for the impoundment constructed above the ground surface appears to collect a substantial portion of the leachate fluxes, but the reminder will bypass the trench and migrate downstream. Those bypassed leachate fluxes will subsequently interact with downstream fluviolacustrine aquifers and eventually discharge into the Yellow River south of the study site under the idealized simulation environment. Further investigations of the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer system and the impoundment dam, and other geochemical characteristics are needed to elucidate the fate and transport of thorium and improve the reliability of the numerical model. Although the discussion and analysis of this study is tailored to thorium reactive transport modeling of a REEs tailings impoundment, such a framework can also be applied to deploy different types of scientific modeling applications on Azure Cloud.},

In this paper, Tikhonov regularization (Tikhonov and Arsenin, 1977) is used in numerical experiments to recover the release history of a plume that has originated from a known, single site. The recovered release history is then used to reconstruct the plume evolution history. The method is found to be insensitive to round off errors, but its accuracy is affected by plume measurement errors, the extent to which the plume has dissipated, and, to a lesser degree, the accuracy of the transport parameter estimates. A regularization approach may be effective at finding a plume history when there are adequate data.},

In conjunction with a comprehensive geochemical review of radionuclides (3H, 14C, 36Cl, 99Tc and 129I) that are presumably mobile in the subsurface, we synthesized a body of radionuclide activity data measured from groundwater samples collected at 18 monitoring wells, to qualitatively assess their migration at the NTS over distances of hundreds of meters and over timescales of decades. Tritium and 36Cl showed little evidence of retardation, while the transport of 14C may have been retarded by its isotopic exchange with carbonate minerals in the aquifer. Observed local reducing conditions (either natural or test-induced) will impact the mobility of certain redox-sensitive radionuclides (especially 99Tc) that were otherwise soluble and readily transported under oxidizing conditions. Conversely, strongly oxidizing conditions may impact the mobility of 129I which is mobile under reducing conditions. The effect of iodine speciation on its transport deserves further attention. Indication of delayed transport of some "mobile" radionuclides (especially 99Tc) in the groundwater at the NTS suggested the importance of redox conditions of the natural system in controlling the fate and transport of radionuclides, which has implications in the enhanced performance of the potential Yucca Mountain repository, located adjacent to the NTS, to store high-level nuclear wastes as well as management of radionuclide contamination in legacy nuclear operations facilities.},

The study site is located in Spain with contamination resulting in groundwater concentrations of up to 50 mg/L of trichloroethene (TCE), the most abundant chlorinated ethene, and 7 mg/L of tetrachloroethene (PCE). The potential sources of contamination including abandoned barrels, an underground tank, and a disposal lagoon, showed a wide range in $\delta$13C values from − 15.6 to − 40.5‰ for TCE and from − 18.5 to − 32.4‰ for PCE, allowing the use of isotope fingerprinting for tracing of the origin and migration of these contaminants in the aquifer. In contrast, there is no difference between the $\delta$37Cl values for TCE in the contaminant sources, ranging from + 0.53 to + 0.66‰. Variations of $\delta$37Cl and $\delta$13C in the different contaminant plumes were used to investigate the role of biodegradation in groundwater. Moreover, the isotopic data were incorporated into a reactive transport model for determination of whether the isotope pattern observed downstream from the tank's source could be explained by the simultaneous effect of mixing and biodegradation. The results demonstrate that a multi-isotope approach is a valuable tool for characterization of complex sites such as fractured bedrock aquifer contaminated by multiple sources, providing important information which can be used by consultants and site managers to prioritize and design more successful remediation strategies.},

We study the time dependent interaction between hydrogeological and exposure parameters in daily dose predictions due to exposure of humans to groundwater contamination. Dose predictions are treated stochastically to account for an incomplete hydrogeological and geochemical field characterization, and an incomplete knowledge of the physiological response. We used a nested Monte Carlo framework to account for uncertainty and variability arising from both hydrogeological and exposure variables. Our interest is in the temporal dynamics of the total dose and their effects on parametric uncertainty reduction. We illustrate the approach to a HCH (lindane) pollution problem at the Ebro River, Spain. The temporal distribution of lindane in the river water can have a strong impact in the evaluation of risk. The total dose displays a non-linear effect on different population cohorts, indicating the need to account for population variability. We then expand the concept of Comparative Information Yield Curves developed earlier to evaluate parametric uncertainty reduction under temporally variable exposure dose. Results show that the importance of parametric uncertainty reduction varies according to the temporal dynamics of the lindane plume. The approach could be used for any chemical to aid decision makers to better allocate resources towards reducing uncertainty.},

@article{Gharamti,
abstract = {The accuracy of groundwater flow and transport model predictions highly depends on our knowledge of subsurface physical parameters. Assimilation of contaminant concentration data from shallow dug wells could help improving model behavior, eventually resulting in better forecasts. In this paper, we propose a joint state-parameter estimation scheme which efficiently integrates a low-rank extended Kalman filtering technique, namely the Singular Evolutive Extended Kalman (SEEK) filter, with the prominent complex-step method (CSM). The SEEK filter avoids the prohibitive computational burden of the Extended Kalman filter by updating the forecast along the directions of error growth only, called filter correction directions. CSM is used within the SEEK filter to efficiently compute model derivatives with respect to the state and parameters along the filter correction directions. CSM is derived using complex Taylor expansion and is second order accurate. It is proven to guarantee accurate gradient computations with zero numerical round-off errors, but requires complexifying the numerical code. We perform twin-experiments to test the performance of the CSM-based SEEK for estimating the state and parameters of a subsurface contaminant transport model. We compare the efficiency and the accuracy of the proposed scheme with two standard finite difference-based SEEK filters as well as with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). Assimilation results suggest that the use of the CSM in the context of the SEEK filter may provide up to 80\% more accurate solutions when compared to standard finite difference schemes and is competitive with the EnKF, even providing more accurate results in certain situations. We analyze the results based on two different observation strategies. We also discuss the complexification of the numerical code and show that this could be efficiently implemented in the context of subsurface flow models.},

The generalized integral transform technique (GITT) is applied to solve the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation (ADE) in heterogeneous porous media coupled with either linear or nonlinear sorption and decay. When both sorption and decay are linear, analytical solutions are obtained using the GITT for one-dimensional ADEs with spatially and temporally variable flow and dispersion coefficient and arbitrary initial and boundary conditions. When either sorption or decay is nonlinear the solutions to ADEs with the GITT are hybrid analytical-numerical. In both linear and nonlinear cases, the forward and inverse integral transforms for the problems described in the paper are apparent and straightforward. Some illustrative examples with linear sorption and decay are presented to demonstrate the application and check the accuracy of the derived analytical solutions. The derived hybrid analytical-numerical solutions are checked against a numerical approach and demonstratively applied to a nonlinear transport example, which simulates a simplified system of iron oxide bioreduction with nonlinear sorption and nonlinear reaction kinetics.},

Evaluating the occurrence of microorganics helps to understand sources and processes which may be controlling the transport and fate of emerging contaminants (ECs). A study was carried out at the contrasting instrumented environmental observatory sites at Oxford, on the peri-urban floodplain gravel aquifer of the River Thames and Boxford, in the rural valley of the River Lambourn on the chalk aquifer, in Southern England to explore the use of ECs to fingerprint contaminant sources and flow pathways in groundwater. At Oxford compounds were typical of a local waste tip plume (not only plasticisers and solvents but also barbiturates and N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET)) and of the urban area (plasticisers and mood-enhancing drugs such as carbamazepine). At Boxford the results were different with widespread occurrence of agricultural pesticides, their metabolites and the solvent trichloroethene, as well as plasticisers, caffeine, butylated food additives, DEET, parabens and trace polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Groups of compounds used in pharmaceuticals and personal care products of different provenance in the environment could be distinguished, i) historical household and medical waste, ii) long-term household usage persistent in groundwater and iii) current usage and contamination from surface water. Co-contaminant and degradation products can also indicate the likely source of contaminants. A cocktail of contaminants can be used as tracers to provide information on catchment pathways and groundwater/surface water interactions. A prominent feature in this study is the attenuation of many EC compounds in the hyporheic zone.},

Despite the highly complex field conditions the numerical three-dimensional multi-component reactive transport model was able to capture most of the spatiotemporal variations of the observed U(VI) concentrations. A multi-model analysis was performed to interrogate the relative importance of various processes and factors for controlling field-scale reactive transport during the uranyl tracer test. The results indicate that multi-rate sorption/desorption, surface complexation reactions, and initial concentrations were the most important processes and factors controlling U(VI) migration. On the other hand, cation exchange reactions, the choice of the surface complexation model, and dual-domain mass transfer processes played less important roles under the prevailing field-test condition. Further analysis of the modeling results demonstrates that these findings are conditioned to the relatively stable groundwater chemistry and the selected length of the field experimental duration (16 days). The model analysis also revealed the crucial role of the intraborehole flow that occurred within the long-screened monitoring wells and thus affected both field measurements and simulated U(VI) concentrations as a combined effect of aquifer heterogeneity and dynamic flow conditions. This study provides the first highly data-constrained uranium transport simulations under highly dynamic flow conditions. It illustrates the value of reactive transport modeling for elucidating the relative importance of individual processes in controlling uranium transport under specific field-scale conditions.},

Release of contaminants from non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) is often limited by the dynamic exchange with aqueous solutions governed by a priori unknown kinetic laws. Release experiments require a thorough evaluation of the potential and limitations of kinetic models to reveal release processes. In this study, we investigated the characteristic concentration-time profiles of various models for the release of contaminants from an organic phase into an aqueous solution under no flow conditions. Criteria have been tested that allow for distinction of a first order one domain, a first order two domain, a spherical diffusion model, a spherical diffusion model with a time variable diffusion coefficient, a model for diffusion in a sphere with organic film, and a model for diffusion in a sphere with an aqueous film. The results can serve to evaluate the processes potentially governing release of organic contaminants from non-aqueous liquid phases.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the influence of high log-conductivity variance ($\sigma$Y2) and local scale dispersion on the first two concentration moments as well as on higher order moments, skewness and kurtosis, in a two-dimensional heterogeneous aquifer. Three different heterogeneity structures are considered, defined with one and the same global isotropic Gaussian variogram. The three structures differ in terms of spatial connectivity patterns at extreme log-conductivity values. Our numerical approach to simulate contaminant transport through heterogeneous porous media is based on the Lagrangian framework with a reverse tracking formulation. Advection and local scale dispersion are two competing and controlling mechanisms, with a relative ratio defined by the Peclet number (Pe); hydraulic log-conductivity variance $\sigma$Y2 in the simulations is assumed to be 1 or 8. The term local scale dispersion is used as a combined effect of molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion. Uncertainty of the concentration field is quantified by the second order moment, or the coefficient of variation (CVC) as a function of the sampling position along a centerline, Peclet number and $\sigma$Y2, as well as by higher order moments, i.e., skewness and kurtosis. $\sigma$Y2 shows a strong influence on the concentration statistics while the three different structures have a minor impact in the case of low heterogeneity. The results also indicate that for $\sigma$Y2 equal to eight, the influence of local scale dispersion is significant after five integral scales (IY) from the source for the CN field, while in case of a DN field, the local scale dispersion effect is observed after 20 IY from the source. In the case of unit $\sigma$Y2, local scale dispersion acts very slowly affecting concentration uncertainty at distances higher than 20 IY from the source. Our inspection of Monte-Carlo (MC) concentration skewness and kurtosis with ones obtained from the Beta distribution show the discrepancies for high $\sigma$Y2 and CN log-conductivity structure.},

abstract = {Results are presented for a large-scale natural gradient tracer experiment conducted in a heterogeneous alluvial aquifer at a site near Columbus, Mississippi. The study was initiated with a 48-hour pulse injection of 10 m3 of groundwater containing bromide and three organic tracers (pentaflourobenzoic acid, o-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid, and 2,6-diflourobenzoic acid). Over a 20-month period, seven comprehensive samplings of the tracer plume were performed at approximately 1- to 4-month intervals using an extensive three-dimensional sampling well network. The dominant feature of the tracer plume that evolved during the study was the highly asymmetric concentration distribution in the longitudinal direction. This asymmetry was produced by accelerating groundwater flow along the plume travel path that, in turn, resulted from an approximate 2-order-of-magnitude increase in the mean hydraulic conductivity between the near-field and far-field regions of the site. The Columbus study is distinct from previous natural gradient experiments because of the extreme heterogeneity of the aquifer, the large-scale spatial variations in groundwater velocity, and the extensive set of hydraulic conductivity measurements for the aquifer.},

Release of contaminants from non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) is often limited by the dynamic exchange with aqueous solutions governed by a priori unknown kinetic laws. Release experiments require a thorough evaluation of the potential and limitations of kinetic models to reveal release processes. In this study, we investigated the characteristic concentration-time profiles of various models for the release of contaminants from an organic phase into an aqueous solution under no flow conditions. Criteria have been tested that allow for distinction of a first order one domain, a first order two domain, a spherical diffusion model, a spherical diffusion model with a time variable diffusion coefficient, a model for diffusion in a sphere with organic film, and a model for diffusion in a sphere with an aqueous film. The results can serve to evaluate the processes potentially governing release of organic contaminants from non-aqueous liquid phases.},

@article{Freyberg1986,
abstract = {The three-dimensional movement of a tracer plume containing bromide and chloride is investigated using the data base from a large-scale natural gradient field experiment on groundwater solute transport. The analysis focuses on the zeroth-, first-, and second-order spatial moments of the concentration distribution. These moments define integrated measures of the dissolved mass, mean solute velocity, and dispersion of the plume. Moments are estimated from the point observations using quadrature approximations tailored to the density of the sampling network. The estimators appear to be robust, with acceptable sampling variability. Estimates of the mass in solution for both bromide and chloride demonstrate that the tracers behaved conservatively, as expected. Analysis of the first-order moment estimates indicates that the experimental tracer plumes traveled along identical trajectories. The horizontal trajectory is linear and aligned with the hydraulic gradient. The vertical trajectory is curvilinear, concave upward. The total vertical displacement is small, however, so that the vertical component of the mean solute velocity vector is negligible. The estimated mean solute velocity is identical for both tracers (0.091 m/day) and is spatially and temporally uniform for the first 647 days of travel time. After 647 days of transport, the plume apparently encountered a relatively large-scale heterogeneity in the velocity field, leading to a distinct vertical layering, and slowing the rate of advance of the center of mass of the plume as a whole. The estimated horizontal components of the covariance tensor evolve over time in a manner consistent with the qualitative shape changes observed from plots of the concentration data. The major principal axis, initially aligned roughly perpendicular to the hydraulic gradient, rotates smoothly over time until it is nearly aligned with the mean solute velocity vector, as the plume itself elongates and orients its long axis with the direction of movement. Plots of the components of the covariance tensor as functions of time show evidence of what is commonly called “scale-dependent” dispersion: the rate of growth of the covariance over time is not linear. The theoretical results of G. Dagan (1984) calibrate well to the estimated covariance data for the first 647 days of transport. The calibrated values of the parameters of the hydrualic conductivity distribution closely match independently measured values from the site. The asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity obtained from the calibration is 0.49 m, although asymptotic conditions were apparently not reached. The estimated covariance terms for the last sampling session, 1038 days after injection, are inconsistent with the earlier data and with the Dagan model, particularly for the transverse and off-diagonal components. This behavior is probably attributable to the observed large-scale heterogeneity in the velocity field.},

Three scenarios are illustrated to show the capabilities of the proposed semianalytical method to deal with aquifer heterogeneity and transient situations.

The solution was found using the Classic Integral Transform Technique (CITT) in combination with a filter function having separable space and time dependencies, implementation of the superposition principle, and using an algebraic transformation that changes the advection–dispersion equation for each species into a diffusion equation. The analytical solution was evaluated using a test case from the literature involving a four radionuclide decay chain. Results show that convergence is slower for advection-dominated transport problems. In all cases, the converged results were identical to those obtained with the previous solution for a semi-infinite domain, except near the exit boundary where differences were expected. Among other applications, the new solution should be useful for benchmarking numerical solutions because of the adoption of a finite spatial domain.},

We also address issues of reproducibility of the solution and the appropriateness of models for simulating random measurement error. The results show that if error-free plume concentration data are available, both methods perform well in reconstructing a smooth source history function. With error-free data the MRE method is more robust than TR in reconstructing a nonsmooth source history function; however, the TR method is more robust if the data contain measurement error. Two error models were evaluated in this study, and we found that the particular error model does not affect the reliability of the solutions. The results for the TR method have somewhat greater reproducibility because, in some cases, its input parameters are less subjective than those of the MRE method; however, the MRE solution can identify regions where the data give little or no information about the source history function, while the TR solution cannot.},

Instantaneous line source release model in two-dimensional domain and continuous point source release model in three-dimensional domain are used for the purpose. Case studies have been carried out for both types of releases to illustrate their application. Error analysis has been carried out to identify the maximum error that can be tolerated in the input concentration data used in the inverse model and to specify the minimum number of sampling points to generate such input data. The LSRM is compared with the well-established correlation coefficient optimization method for instantaneous line source release model, and good comparison is observed between them. The LSRM is used to quantitatively estimate the releases of different radionuclides into the Pacific Ocean which has resulted due to the discharge of highly radioactive liquid effluent from the affected Daiichi Nuclear Power Station at Fukushima in Japan. The measured concentrations of these radionuclides in seawater samples collected from two sampling points near Fukushima are used for the estimation. The average release works out to be 1.09 × 1016 for 131I, 3.4 × 1015 Bq for 134Cs, and 3.57 × 1015 Bq for 137Cs.

abstract = {Many numerical computer codes used to simulate multi-species reactive transport and biodegradation have been developed in recent years. Such numerical codes must be validated by comparison of the numerical solutions with an analytical solution. In this paper, a method for deriving analytical solutions of the partial differential equations describing multiple species multi-dimensional transport with first-order sequential reactions is presented. Although others have developed specific solutions of multi-species transport equations, here a more general analytical approach, capable of describing any number of reactive species in multiple dimensions is derived. A substitution method is used to transform the multi-species reactive transport problem to one that can be solved using previously published single-species solutions for various initial and boundary conditions. One- and three-dimensional examples are presented to illustrate the steps involved in extending single-species solutions to a four-species system with sequential first-order reactions.},

abstract = {The permeable reactive barrier (PRB) remediation technology has proven to be more cost-effective than conventional pump-and-treat systems, and has demonstrated the ability to rapidly reduce the concentrations of specific chemicals of concern (COCs) by up to several orders of magnitude in some scenarios. This study derives new steady-state analytical solutions to multispecies reactive transport in a PRB–aquifer (dual domain) system. The advantage of the dual domain model is that it can account for the potential existence of natural degradation in the aquifer, when designing the required PRB thickness. The study focuses primarily on the steady-state analytical solutions of the tetrachloroethene (PCE) serial degradation pathway and secondly on the analytical solutions of the parallel degradation pathway. The solutions in this study can also be applied to other types of dual domain systems with distinct flow and transport properties. The steady-state analytical solutions are shown to be accurate and the numerical program RT3D is selected for comparison. The results of this study are novel in that the solutions provide improved modeling flexibility including: 1) every species can have unique first-order reaction rates and unique retardation factors, and 2) daughter species can be modeled with their individual input concentrations or solely as byproducts of the parent species. The steady-state analytical solutions exhibit a limitation that occurs when interspecies reaction rate factors equal each other, which result in undefined solutions. Excel spreadsheet programs were created to facilitate prompt application of the steady-state analytical solutions, for both the serial and parallel degradation pathways.},

@article{Sudicky1990,
abstract = {A new and efficient technique is presented for numerical solution of solute transport problems in multi-dimensional double-porosity media. The method is based on the Laplace Transform Galerkin (LTG) technique (Sudicky, 1989) and employs a convolution integral in the governing advection-dispersion equation to express the diffusive exchange of solute between the mobile and immobile regions. Because the Laplace transformation is applied to the advection-dispersion equation describing transport in the mobile region, the convolution integral, in addition to the temporal derivative, is effectively removed. After the transformed equation is solved using the Galerkin finite element method, nodal concentrations in the time-domain are obtained using a robust and efficient algorithm for inversion of the Laplace-domain nodal concentrations. The method permits the solution to be evaluated at any future point in time without any need for time steps and permits the use of grids having a relatively coarse spatial discretization while avoiding significant numerical dispersion. Further computational efficiency is achieved for large-grid problems by employing an ORTHOMIN-accelerated iterative solver (Vinsome, 1976) to solve the system of Laplace-domain finite element equations. Influence functions describing the mobile-immobile region solute transfer are presented for the case of slab and sphere geometries for the immobile-fluid zone and for the case of first-order exchange theory, along with expressions which unify the three approaches. The utility of the model is demonstrated by applying it to the problem of solute transport in a sandy-type aquifer having a random, spatially-correlated hydraulic conductivity field and comprised of slightly porous grains that admit intragranular diffusion but do not conduct fluid.},

abstract = {The groundwater remediation field has been changing constantly since it first emerged in the 1970s. The remediation field has evolved from a dissolved-phase centric conceptual model to a DNAPL-dominated one, which is now being questioned due to a renewed appreciation of matrix diffusion effects on remediation. Detailed observations about contaminant transport have emerged from the remediation field, and challenge the validity of one of the mainstays of the groundwater solute transport modeling world: the concept of mechanical dispersion (Payne et al. 2008). We review and discuss how a new conceptual model of contaminant transport based on diffusion (the usurper) may topple the well-established position of mechanical dispersion (the status quo) that is commonly used in almost every groundwater contaminant transport model, and evaluate the status of existing models and modeling studies that were conducted using advection-dispersion models.},

@article{Jury1982,
abstract = {A transfer function model is proposed for simulating solute transport under natural field conditions where substantial variability exists in water transport properties. This approach makes no attempt to describe the variability through a deterministic model but merely measures the distribution of solute travel times from the soil surface to a reference depth. Using this distribution function, it is possible to simulate the average solute concentrations at any depth and time for arbitrary solute inputs or water application variability. Equivalently, the model may be used to predict the probability of extremely long or short travel times for a mobile chemical. In this paper several illustrative calculations are performed for which analytic solutions are possible. In a companion paper (Jury et al., this issue) a field test of the model is reported.},

@article{Srzic2013a,
abstract = {In this paper we study the influence of high log-conductivity variance ($\sigma$Y2) and local scale dispersion on the first two concentration moments as well as on higher order moments, skewness and kurtosis, in a two-dimensional heterogeneous aquifer. Three different heterogeneity structures are considered, defined with one and the same global isotropic Gaussian variogram. The three structures differ in terms of spatial connectivity patterns at extreme log-conductivity values. Our numerical approach to simulate contaminant transport through heterogeneous porous media is based on the Lagrangian framework with a reverse tracking formulation. Advection and local scale dispersion are two competing and controlling mechanisms, with a relative ratio defined by the Peclet number (Pe); hydraulic log-conductivity variance $\sigma$Y2 in the simulations is assumed to be 1 or 8. The term local scale dispersion is used as a combined effect of molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion. Uncertainty of the concentration field is quantified by the second order moment, or the coefficient of variation (CVC) as a function of the sampling position along a centerline, Peclet number and $\sigma$Y2, as well as by higher order moments, i.e., skewness and kurtosis. $\sigma$Y2 shows a strong influence on the concentration statistics while the three different structures have a minor impact in the case of low heterogeneity. The results also indicate that for $\sigma$Y2 equal to eight, the influence of local scale dispersion is significant after five integral scales (IY) from the source for the CN field, while in case of a DN field, the local scale dispersion effect is observed after 20 IY from the source. In the case of unit $\sigma$Y2, local scale dispersion acts very slowly affecting concentration uncertainty at distances higher than 20 IY from the source. Our inspection of Monte-Carlo (MC) concentration skewness and kurtosis with ones obtained from the Beta distribution show the discrepancies for high $\sigma$Y2 and CN log-conductivity structure.},
