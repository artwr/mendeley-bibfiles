abstract = {Abstract 
Release of contaminants from non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) is often limited by the dynamic exchange with aqueous solutions governed by a priori unknown kinetic laws. Release experiments require a thorough evaluation of the potential and limitations of kinetic models to reveal release processes. In this study, we investigated the characteristic concentration-time profiles of various models for the release of contaminants from an organic phase into an aqueous solution under no flow conditions. Criteria have been tested that allow for distinction of a first order one domain, a first order two domain, a spherical diffusion model, a spherical diffusion model with a time variable diffusion coefficient, a model for diffusion in a sphere with organic film, and a model for diffusion in a sphere with an aqueous film. The results can serve to evaluate the processes potentially governing release of organic contaminants from non-aqueous liquid phases.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the influence of high log-conductivity variance ($\sigma$Y2) and local scale dispersion on the first two concentration moments as well as on higher order moments, skewness and kurtosis, in a two-dimensional heterogeneous aquifer. Three different heterogeneity structures are considered, defined with one and the same global isotropic Gaussian variogram. The three structures differ in terms of spatial connectivity patterns at extreme log-conductivity values. Our numerical approach to simulate contaminant transport through heterogeneous porous media is based on the Lagrangian framework with a reverse tracking formulation. Advection and local scale dispersion are two competing and controlling mechanisms, with a relative ratio defined by the Peclet number (Pe); hydraulic log-conductivity variance $\sigma$Y2 in the simulations is assumed to be 1 or 8. The term local scale dispersion is used as a combined effect of molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion. Uncertainty of the concentration field is quantified by the second order moment, or the coefficient of variation (CVC) as a function of the sampling position along a centerline, Peclet number and $\sigma$Y2, as well as by higher order moments, i.e., skewness and kurtosis. $\sigma$Y2 shows a strong influence on the concentration statistics while the three different structures have a minor impact in the case of low heterogeneity. The results also indicate that for $\sigma$Y2 equal to eight, the influence of local scale dispersion is significant after five integral scales (IY) from the source for the CN field, while in case of a DN field, the local scale dispersion effect is observed after 20 IY from the source. In the case of unit $\sigma$Y2, local scale dispersion acts very slowly affecting concentration uncertainty at distances higher than 20 IY from the source. Our inspection of Monte-Carlo (MC) concentration skewness and kurtosis with ones obtained from the Beta distribution show the discrepancies for high $\sigma$Y2 and CN log-conductivity structure.},

abstract = {In order to measure groundwater age and design nuclear waste disposal sites, it is important to understand the sorption behavior of tritium on soils. In this study, batch tests were carried out using four soils from China: silty clays from An County and Jiangyou County in Sichuan Province, both of which could be considered candidate sites for Very Low Level Waste disposal; silty sand from Beijing; and loess from Yuci County in Shanxi Province, a typical Chinese loess region. The experimental results indicated that in these soil media, the distribution coefficient of tritium is slightly influenced by adsorption time, water/solid ratio, initial tritium specific activity, pH, and the content of humic and fulvic acids. The average distribution coefficient from all of these influencing factors was about 0.1-0.2 mL/g for the four types of soil samples. This relatively modest sorption of tritium in soils needs to be considered in fate and transport studies of tritium in the environment.},

abstract = {Many long-lived radionuclides are present in groundwater at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) as a result of 828 underground nuclear weapons tests conducted between 1951 and 1992. In conjunction with a comprehensive geochemical review of radionuclides (3H, 14C, 36Cl, 99Tc and 129I) that are presumably mobile in the subsurface, we synthesized a body of radionuclide activity data measured from groundwater samples collected at 18 monitoring wells, to qualitatively assess their migration at the NTS over distances of hundreds of meters and over timescales of decades. Tritium and 36Cl showed little evidence of retardation, while the transport of 14C may have been retarded by its isotopic exchange with carbonate minerals in the aquifer. Observed local reducing conditions (either natural or test-induced) will impact the mobility of certain redox-sensitive radionuclides (especially 99Tc) that were otherwise soluble and readily transported under oxidizing conditions. Conversely, strongly oxidizing conditions may impact the mobility of 129I which is mobile under reducing conditions. The effect of iodine speciation on its transport deserves further attention. Indication of delayed transport of some "mobile" radionuclides (especially 99Tc) in the groundwater at the NTS suggested the importance of redox conditions of the natural system in controlling the fate and transport of radionuclides, which has implications in the enhanced performance of the potential Yucca Mountain repository, located adjacent to the NTS, to store high-level nuclear wastes as well as management of radionuclide contamination in legacy nuclear operations facilities.},
