abstract = {Understanding the fate of contaminant in wetland flows is essential in applications such as ecological risk assessment and environmental hydraulic design. Presented in this paper is an analytical study on the dispersion of contaminant in a two-zone wetland, with the effect of ecological degradation taken into consideration. Environmental dispersion is discussed separately via an exponential transformation for the general formulation of contaminant transport. Taylor’s classical analysis for solute dispersion in a long and thin tube flow is rigorously generalized for the dispersion of the lateral mean contaminant concentration in the longitudinal direction. A method of asymptotic analysis is adopted instead of the concentration moment method in order to simplify the process of deduction and the expression of the analytical solution. Gill’s method of mean concentration expansion is applied to model the concentration deviation terms produced in an averaging operation. With the velocity profile obtained previously, the enhancement of the environmental dispersivity under long time evolution is determined and shown to be consistent with that obtained by the method of concentration moment. Analytical solutions for the evolution of the contaminant concentration and the influenced region of the contaminant cloud are obtained by combining both the hydraulic and the ecological effects. For typical pollutant as the heavy metal Hg, the evolution of contaminant cloud is illustrated by critical length and duration in an application with concentration beyond some given environmental standard level. Results show that for wetland flows with a two-zone structure, the influenced region is reduced evidently while the duration of the contaminant cloud remains nearly unchanged, compared with that for the single-zone wetland flow.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterize the temporal behavior of contaminant mass discharge, and the relationship between reductions in contaminant mass discharge and reductions in contaminant mass, for a very heterogeneous, highly contaminated source-zone field site. Trichloroethene is the primary contaminant of concern, and several lines of evidence indicate the presence of organic liquid in the subsurface. The site is undergoing groundwater extraction for source control, and contaminant mass discharge has been monitored since system startup. The results show a significant reduction in contaminant mass discharge with time, decreasing from approximately 1 to 0.15 kg/d. Two methods were used to estimate the mass of contaminant present in the source area at the initiation of the remediation project. One was based on a comparison of two sets of core data, collected 3.5 years apart, which suggests that a significant (\~{} 80\%) reduction in aggregate sediment-phase TCE concentrations occurred between sampling events. The second method was based on fitting the temporal contaminant mass discharge data with a simple exponential source-depletion function. Relatively similar estimates, 784 and 993 kg, respectively, were obtained with the two methods. These data were used to characterize the relationship between reductions in contaminant mass discharge (CMDR) and reductions in contaminant mass (MR). The observed curvilinear relationship exhibits a reduction in contaminant mass discharge essentially immediately upon initiation of mass reduction. This behavior is consistent with a system wherein significant quantities of mass are present in hydraulically poorly accessible domains for which mass removal is influenced by rate-limited mass transfer. The results obtained from the present study are compared to those obtained from other field studies to evaluate the impact of system properties and conditions on mass-discharge and mass-removal behavior. The results indicated that factors such as domain scale, hydraulic-gradient status (induced or natural), and flushing-solution composition had insignificant impact on the CMDR-MR profiles and thus on underlying mass-removal behavior. Conversely, source-zone age, through its impact on contaminant distribution and accessibility, was implicated as a critical factor influencing the nature of the CMDR-MR relationship.},

abstract = {Water distribution network models for large municipalities have tens of thousands of interconnecting pipes and junctions with complex hydraulic controls. Many water security applications, including sensor placement optimization, require detailed simulation of potential contamination incidents. The post-simulation optimization problem can easily exceed memory on standard desktop computers. Large networks can be skeletonized to reduce computation; however, this alters network hydraulics and, therefore, sensor placement. The objective of this paper is to evaluate a two-tiered sensor placement approach that combines hydraulic and water quality simulations using “all-pipes”, or original, network models with subsequent geographic aggregation of time and impact values to reduce memory requirements. The two-tiered approach first places sensors on aggregated regions, then refines the solution to actual nodes in the original model. The two-tiered sensor placement approach is compared to results using the original n...},
