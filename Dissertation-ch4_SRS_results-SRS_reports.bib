abstract = {This report is the first revision to a series of reports on radionuclides inn the SRS environment. Tritium was chosen as the first radionuclide in the series because the calculations used to assess the dose to the offsite population from SRS releases indicate that the dose due to tritium, through of small consequence, is one of the most important the radionuclides. This was recognized early in the site operation, and extensive measurements of tritium in the atmosphere, surface water, and ground water exist due to the effort of the Environmental Monitoring Section. In addition, research into the transport and fate of tritium in the environment has been supported at the SRS by both the local Department of Energy (DOE) Office and DOE's Office of Health and Environmental Research.},

abstract = {Radionuclide concentrations were measured in soil and vegetation growing adjacent to and in the Savannah River Laboratory Seepage Basins as part of the plan for closure of the basin system. The results of the measurements provide some information about the mobility of the radionuclides introduced into the basins. \{sup 90\}Sr is the most mobile of the radionuclides in soil. Its high mobility and high relative uptake by vegetation cause \{sup 90\}Sr to be distributed throughout the basin system. \{sup 137\}Cs is not as mobile in the basin soil, limiting its uptake by vegetation growing on the edge of the seepage basins; however, it is readily taken up by the vegetation growing in the basins. Soil mobility and vegetation uptake is relatively low for all of the transuranic radionuclides. For the most part these radionuclides remain near the surface of the basin soils where they were absorbed from the waste-water. The relative role of soil mobility and vegetation uptake on the distribution of radionuclide at the basins was futher evaluated by comparing the vegetation concentration ratio and the half-depth of penetration of the radionuclides in the basin soil. The results suggest that vegetation processes dominate in determining the concentration of \{sup 60\}Co and \{sup 137\}Cs in the vegetation. The influences of soil and vegetation are more balanced for \{sup 90\}Sr. The other radionuclides exhibit both low soil mobility and low vegetation uptake. The lack of soil mobility is seen in the lower concentrations found in vegetation growing on the edge of the basin compared to those growing in the basin.},

abstract = {At the Savannah River Site's F-Area, wastewaters containing radionuclides were disposed into seepage basins for decades. After closure and capping in 1991, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has being monitoring and remediating the groundwater plume. Despite numerous studies of the plume, its persistence for over 20 years has not been well understood. To better understand the plume dynamics, a limited number of deep boreholes were drilled to determine the current plume characteristics. A mixing model was developed to predict plume tritium and nitrate concentrations. We found that the plume trailing edges have emerged for some contaminants, and that contaminant recharge from the basin's vadose zone is still important. The model's estimated time-dependent basin drainage rates combined with dilution from natural recharge successfully predicted plume tritium and nitrate concentrations. This new understanding of source zone influences can help guide science-based remediation, and improve predictions of the natural attenuation timeframes.},

@article{Corbett1997,
abstract = {The groundwater contribution into Par Pond, a former cooling reservoir
for two nuclear reactors located on the Department of Energy's Savannah
River Site (South Carolina), was estimated using a standard hydrologic
budget as well as one augmented by a natural tracer approach. We
determined a geochemical budget for 222Rn, normally found at much
higher concentrations in groundwater than surface waters, to assist
in constraining the hydrologic estimates. The radon budget accounted
for all quantifiable surface sources and sinks including the flux
across the sediment-water interface which was determined by application
of an advection-diffusion model. All hydrologic parameters and radon
concentrations were monitored seasonally from February 1994 to August
1995. Using the water balance approach alone, the average groundwater
discharge entering the lake was estimated to have an upper limit
of approximately 0.95 � 0.13 m3 s-1. The groundwater contribution
obtained using the combined hydrologic/222Rn approach ranged from
0.17 to 0.76 m3 s-1 with a best estimate of 0.35 � 0.16 m3 s-1. Lake
profiles show enhanced 222Rn concentrations in some areas indicating
that groundwater enters Par Pond mostly through a small region in
the northern portion of the lake, probably via small seeps or springs.
Estimates show that groundwater plays a significant role in the overall
water budget of the lake, accounting for 10\%-33\% of the total estimated
inflow from all measured sources. Our results show that supplementing
a standard hydrological water balance with radon budget considerations
helps to constrain estimated groundwater flow into surface reservoirs.},

@article{Dong2012,
abstract = {The mobility of an acidic uranium waste plume in the F-Area of Savannah River Site is of great concern. In order to understand and predict uranium mobility, U(VI) adsorption experiments were performed as a function of pH using background F-Area aquifer sediments and reference goethite and kaolinite (major reactive phases of F-Area sediments), and a component-additivity (CA) based surface complexation model (SCM) was developed. Our experimental results indicate that the fine fractions (≤45 $\mu$m) in sediments control U(VI) adsorption due to their large surface area, although the quartz sands show a stronger adsorption ability per unit surface area than the fine fractions at pH < 5.0. Kaolinite is a more important sorbent for U(VI) at pH < 4.0, while goethite plays a major role at pH > 4.0. Our CA model combines an existing U(VI) SCM for goethite and a modified U(VI) SCM for kaolinite along with estimated relative surface area abundances of these component minerals. The modeling approach successfully predicts U(VI) adsorption behavior by the background F-Area sediments. The model suggests that exchange sites on kaolinite dominate U(VI) adsorption at pH < 4.0, goethite and kaolinite edge sites cocontribute to U(VI) adsorption at pH 4.0-6.0, and goethite dominates U(VI) adsorption at pH > 6.0.},

The fate of the tritium released is evaluated through environmental monitoring, special studies, and modeling. It is concluded that approximately 91\% of the tritium remaining after decay is now in the oceans. A dose and risk assessment to the population around the site is presented. It is concluded that about 0.6 fatal cancers may be associated with the tritium released during all the years of operation to the population of about 625,000. This same population (based on the overall US cancer statistics) is expected to experience about 105,000 cancer fatalities from all types of cancer. Therefore, it is considered unlikely that a relationship between any of the cancer deaths occurring in this population and releases of tritium from the SRS will be found.},
