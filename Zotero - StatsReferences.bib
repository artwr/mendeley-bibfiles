@article{Yen1956,
abstract = {The purpose of this investigation is to examine four special nonuniform sampling processes in detail, and to deduce some interesting properties of bandwidth-limited signals. The main results are contained in four generalized sampling theorems. These theorems not only contain the nature of determination (unique-specification, over-specification, and underspecification) of signals but also include explicit reconstruction formulas. From the reconstruction formulas, the complexity and accuracy of the nonuniform sampling processes discussed can be estimated. In addition, these theorems lead to observations regarding the allowable shapes, the "prediction," and the "energy" of bandwidth-limited signals in general. A "minimum-energy" signal is introduced which has certain advantages as compared to the ordinary "time-limited" signals when a finite number of sample values are given. Finally, a statement due to Cauchy on the sampling of bandwidth-limited signals is generalized to include a wider class of nonuniform sample point distributions and modified to give more exact information regarding the nature of determination of signals.},

@article{Arlot2010a,
abstract = {Used to estimate the risk of an estimator or to perform model selection, cross-validation is a widespread strategy because of its simplicity and its (apparent) universality. Many results exist on model selection performances of cross-validation procedures. This survey intends to relate these results to the most recent advances of model selection theory, with a particular emphasis on distinguishing empirical statements from rigorous theoretical results. As a conclusion, guidelines are provided for choosing the best cross-validation procedure according to the particular features of the problem in hand.},

@article{Goodman1960,
abstract = {Abstract A simple exact formula for the variance of the product of two random variables, say, x and y, is given as a function of the means and central product-moments of x and y. The usual approximate variance formula for xy is compared with this exact formula; e.g., we note, in the special case where x and y are independent, that the ?variance? computed by the approximate formula is less than the exact variance, and that the accuracy of the approximation depends on the sum of the reciprocals of the squared coefficients of variation of x and y. The case where x and y need not be independent is also studied, and exact variance formulas are presented for several different ?product estimates.? (The usefulness of exact formulas becomes apparent when the variances of these estimates are compared.) When x and y are independent, simple unbiased estimates of these exact variances are suggested; in the more general case, consistent estimates are presented.

abstract = {Computer-intensive algorithms, such as the Gibbs sampler, have become increasingly popular statistical tools, both in applied and theoretical work. The properties of such algorithms, however, may sometimes not be obvious. Here we give a simple explanation of how and why the Gibbs sampler works. We analytically establish its properties in a simple case and provide insight for more complicated cases. There are also a number of examples.},
