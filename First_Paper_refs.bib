@article{Beals1995,
abstract = {Surface water samples were collected from streams on and around the
Savannah River Site (SRS) to assess current3H, 99Tc, and 129I concentrations
in the water. The SRS is a nuclear facility operated by Westinghouse
Savannah River Company for the US Department of Energy. Water quality
parameters were measured at the time of collection using field portable
instrumentation. The tritium activity was determined by liquid scintillation
spectrometry. The isotopes, 99Tc and 129I, were determined by isotope
dilution/inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (D.M. Beals,
Determination of technetium-99 in aqueous samples by isotope dilution
inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Presented at the 3rd
International Conference on Nuclear and Radiochemistry, Vienna, September
1992, unpublished data; D.M. Beals, P. Chastagner and P.K. Turner,
Analysis of iodine-129 in aqueous samples by inductively coupled
plasma-mass spectrometry. Presented at the 38th Annual Conference
on Bioassay, Analytical and Environmental Radiochemistry, Santa Fe,
NM, November 1992). Elevated activities of 3H, 99Tc, and 129I were
found in some surface streams of the SRS, principally due to migration
of ground water from beneath old seepage basins, however the levels
in the waters leaving the SRS are well below any regulatory guidelines.},
