abstract = {This article identifies a set of serious theoretical mistakes appearing with troublingly high frequency throughout the quantitative political science literature. These mistakes are all based on faulty statistical theory or on erroneous statistical analysis. Through algebraic and interpretive proofs, some of the most commonly made mistakes are explicated and illus- trated. The theoretical problem underlying each is highlighted, and suggested solutions are provided throughout. It is argued that closer attention to these problems and solutions will result in more reliable quantitative analyses and more useful theoretical contributions.},

abstract = {Social scientists rarely take full advantage of the information available in their statistical results. As a consequence, they miss opportunities to present quantities that are of greatest substantive interest for their research and express the appropriate degree of certainty about these quantities. In this article, we offer an approach, built on the technique of statistical simulation, to extract the currently overlooked information from any statistical method and to interpret and present it in a reader-friendly manner. Using this technique requires some expertise, which we try to provide herein, but its application should make the results of quantitative articles more informative and transparent. To illustrate our recommendations, we replicate the results of several published works, showing in each case how the authors’ own conclusions can be expressed more sharply and informatively, and, without changing any data or statistical assumptions, how our approach reveals important new information about the research questions at hand. We also offer very easy-to-use software that implements our suggestions.},

@unpublished{Imai2009,
abstract = {In a highly influential paper, Baron and Kenny (1986) proposed a statistical procedure to con- duct a causal mediation analysis and identify possible causal mechanisms. This procedure has been widely used across many branches of the social and medical sciences and especially in psychology and epidemiology. However, one major limitation of this approach is that it is based on a set of linear regressions and cannot be easily extended to more complex situations that are frequently encoun- tered in applied research. In this paper, we propose an approach that generalizes the Baron-Kenny procedure. Our method can accommodate linear and nonlinear relationships, parametric and non- parametric models, continuous and discrete mediators, and various types of outcome variables. We also provide a formal statistical justification for the proposed generalization of the Baron-Kenny pro- cedure by placing causal mediation analysis within the widely-accepted counterfactual framework of causal inference. Finally, we develop a set of sensitivity analyses that allow applied researchers to quantify the robustness of their empirical conclusions. Such sensitivity analysis is important because as we showthe Baron-Kenny procedure and our generalization of it rest on a strong and untestable as- sumption even in randomized experiments. We illustrate the proposed methods by applying them to a randomized field experiment, the Job Search Intervention Study (JOBS II).We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all of our proposed methods.},

abstract = {This article reviews methodologies used for analyzing ordered categorical (ordinal) response variables. We begin by surveying models for data with a single ordinal response variable. We also survey recently proposed strategies for modeling ordinal response variables when the data have some type of clustering or when repeated measurement occurs at various occasions for each subject, such as in longitudinal studies. Primary models in that case include marginal models and cluster-specific (conditional) models for which effects apply conditionally at the cluster level. Re- lated discussion refers to multi-level and transitional models. The main empha- sis is on maximum likelihood inference, although we indicate certain models (e.g., marginal models,multi-level models) for which this can be computationally difficult. The Bayesian approach has also received considerable attention for categorical data in the past decade, and we survey recent Bayesian approaches to modeling ordinal response variables. Alternative, non-model-based, approaches are also available for certain types of inference.},

abstract = {Experiments have become an increasingly common tool for political science researchers over the last decade, particularly laboratory experiments performed on small convenience samples. The standard statistical paradigm used in political science is designed to connect samples to populations, while the inferential goal in an experiment is often about understand- ing whether an observed treatment effect occurred due to chance. In this paper, we outline an alternative derivation for statistical inference based on randomization of the treatment. While some standard tests approximate this form of inference, many do not and can produce incorrect inferences. These tests also have robust forms that are insensitive to the distribu- tion of the data. We outline common randomization tests, such as Wilcoxon rank tests and the Kruskal-Wallis test, and also develop a randomization test for two-way factorial designs as an alternative to the commonly used two-way ANOVA model. Finally, we reanalyze data from two political science experiments using randomization tests to illustrate the inferential errors that can be made when classical tests are used with data from the lab.},

Therefore calculating the distances from the centroids needs vector operations, since the average of abstract data points is undefined.

This extension may be named relational k-means after a notation for a similar algorithm invented for fuzzy clustering. A method is then proposed for generalizing k-means for scenarios when the data points have absolutely no connection with a Euclidean space.},

@unpublished{Franzese2001,
abstract = {Despite occasional constructive pedagogical treatises on the topic in the past (e.g., Friedrich 1982), a common methodology for employing and interpreting interaction terms in regression analysis continues to elude the field; and, partly as a consequence, their misinterpretation remains sadly rampant. This paper aims to redress these problems. We first document the widespread and expanding use of interaction terms in political science. We then elaborate and support our claim that, despite the increased use of interaction terms in regression analyses, many inherently interactive arguments are not being modeled as such. Finally, we note and review several inconsistencies and much confusion in the literature regarding the substantive interpretation of interaction terms and the statistical inferences from the coefficient and standard-error estimates surrounding them. After this review, we discuss three pedagogical themes. First, we offer a generic consideration of the process of writing empirical models that embody interactive hypotheses. Our second theme focuses more specifically on a set of statistical practices and rules of thumb when utilizing interaction models suggested by previous methodological treatments of the topic and frequently employed in current political science literature. We demonstrate that many of these can be misleading. Finally, we discuss the presentation of interaction effects. We show that, while the existing practice of reporting standard errors for individual coefficients remains useful, that practice is decidedly insufficient regarding coefficients on interactive terms. Assessment of interaction effects virtually requires graphical or tabular presentation of results, neither of which is currently commonly published. In this context, we strongly suggest the use of effect-line graphs or conditional-coefficient tables, complete with standard errors, hypothesis tests, and/or confidence intervals of those effects or conditional coefficients. We show how to construct these graphs and tables, giving detailed spreadsheet formulae for doing so in addition to the standard mathematical formulae for their elements.},

Institutional arguments frequently imply that the relationship between political inputs and outcomes varies depending on the institutional context. Models of strategic interaction typically produce conditional hypotheses as well. Although con- ditional hypotheses are ubiquitous in political science and multiplicative interaction models have been found to capture their intuition quite well, a survey of the top three political science journals from 1998 to 2002 suggests that the execution of these models is often flawed and inferential errors are common. We believe that considerable progress in our understanding of the political world can occur if scholars follow the simple checklist of dos and don’ts for using multiplicative interaction models presented in this article. Only 10\% of the articles in our survey followed the checklist.},

There exists a threshold beyond which social contact becomes irritating for all parties; therefore, some provision for removing oneself from interaction and observation must be built into every establishment. Such provisions subserve the action patterns for which they provide intermission. Privacy, which is bought and sold in social establishments, reflects and affirms status divisions, and permits "localized" deviation which is invisible to the group as a whole. Privacy thereby unsulates against dysfunctional knowledge. Rules governing entrance into and exit from privacy are most clearly articulated on the level of the establishment and are reflected in its physical structure and in proprieties concerning the uses of space, doors, windows, drawers, etc. The report ends with a discussion of identity and its relation to the freedoms of engagement and disengagement.},
