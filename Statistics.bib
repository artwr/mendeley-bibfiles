abstract = {A kernel smoother is an intuitive estimate of a regression function or conditional expectation; at each point \$x\_0\$ the estimate of \$E(Y\backslash mid x\_0)\$ is a weighted mean of the sample \$Y\_i\$, with observations close to \$x\_0\$ receiving the largest weights. Unfortunately this simplicity has flaws. At the boundary of the predictor space, the kernel neighborhood is asymmetric and the estimate may have substantial bias. Bias can be a problem in the interior as well if the predictors are nonuniform or if the regression function has substantial curvature. These problems are particularly severe when the predictors are multidimensional. A variety of kernel modifications have been proposed to provide approximate and asymptotic adjustment for these biases. Such methods generally place substantial restrictions on the regression problems that can be considered; in unfavorable situations, they can perform very poorly. Moreover, the necessary modifications are very difficult to implement in the multidimensional case. Local r...},

abstract = {This article proposes a method for nonparametric estimation of hazard rates as a function of time and possibly multiple covariates. The method is based on dividing the time axis into intervals, and calculating number of event and follow-up time contributions from the different intervals. The number of event and follow-up time data are then separately smoothed on time and the covariates, and the hazard rate estimators obtained by taking the ratio. Pointwise consistency and asymptotic normality are shown for the hazard rate estimators for a certain class of smoothers, which includes some standard approaches to locally weighted regression and kernel regression. It is shown through simulation that a variance estimator based on this asymptotic distribution is reasonably reliable in practice. The problem of how to select the smoothing parameter is considered, but a satisfactory resolution to this problem has not been identified. The method is illustrated using data from several breast cancer clinical trials.},

Attention is focused on local polynomial smoothers. Both the mean and variance functions are assumed to be smooth, but neither is assumed to be in a parametric family. The biasing effect of preliminary estimation of the mean is studied, and a degrees-of-freedom correction of bias is proposed. The corrected method is shown to be adaptive in the sense that the variance function can be estimated with the same asymptotic mean and variance as if the mean function were known. A proposal is made for using standard bandwidth selectors for estimating both the mean and variance functions. The proposal is illustrated with data from the LIDAR method of measuring atmospheric pollutants and from turbulence-model computations.},
