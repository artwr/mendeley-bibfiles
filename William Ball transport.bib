Although progress has been made toward understanding the surface chemistry of granular iron and the mechanisms through which it attenuates groundwater contaminants, potential long-term changes in the solute transport properties of granular iron media have until now received relatively little attention. As part of column investigations of alterations in the reactivity of granular iron, studies using tritiated water (3H2O) as a conservative and non-partitioning tracer were periodically conducted to independently isolate transport-related effects on performance from those more directly related to surface reactivity. Hydraulic residence time distributions (HRTDs) within each of six 39-cm columns exposed to bicarbonate solutions were obtained over the course of 1100 days of operation. First moment analyses of the data revealed generally modest increases in mean pore water velocity (v) over time, indicative of decreasing water-filled porosity. Gravimetric measurements provided independent estimates of water-filled porosity that were initially consistent with those obtained from 3H2O tracer tests, although at later times, porosities derived from gravimetric measurements deviated from the tracer test results owing to mineral precipitation. The combination of gravimetric measurements and 3H2O tracer studies furnished estimates of precipitated mineral mass; depending on the assumed identity of the predominant mineral phase(s), the porosity decrease associated with solute precipitation amounted to 6-24\% of the initial porosity. The accumulation of mineral and gas phases led to the formation of regions of immobile water and increased spreading of the tracer pulse. Application of a dual-region transport model to the 3H2O breakthrough curves revealed that the immobile water-filled region increased from initially negligible values to amounts ranging between 3\% and 14\% of the total porosity in later periods of operation. For the aged columns, mobile-immobile mass transfer coefficients (kmt) were generally in the range of 0.1-1.0 day-1 and reflected a slow exchange of 3H2O between the two regions. Additional model calculations incorporating sorption and reaction suggest that although changes in HRTD can have an appreciable effect on trichloroethylene (TCE) transformation, the effect is likely to be minor relative to that stemming from passivation of the granular iron surface.},

An unconfined floodplain aquifer near Missoula, MT, was instrumented with 89 monitoring wells and 20 four-port multilevel samplers. Bromide, bacteriophages MS2, PRD1 and [empty set]X174 and the attenuated enterovirus, polio virus (type-1 CHAT strain), were seeded into the aquifer as slug injections. Bromide transport rates ranged between 22-29�m/d. Input concentrations of the tracers and the placement of monitoring wells limited detection of bromide and polio virus to 19.4�m and the detection of three bacteriophage to 40.5�m downgradient from the injection point. After 7.5�m of transport, the calculated relative attenuations [Harvey R. W and Garabedian S. P. (1991) Env. Sci. Tech. 25, 178-185] for MS2, PRD-1, [empty set]X174 and attenuated polio virus were 49, 71, 65 and 99\%, respectively. During the 72-h experiment, die-off was negligible (less than 1\%) and attachment of virus to sediment surfaces resulted in the overall differences in bromide and virus behavior. Although relative attenuations at downgradient monitoring wells indicated that the virus tracers were attaching to aquifer material along the flowpath, virus peaks arrived at observation wells at rates similar to the bromide peak. The high collision efficiency of the attenuated polio virus resulted in breakthrough curve truncation. Natural attenuation of slug input virus over a },

Diffusion of dissolved contaminants in multilayer porous media is an important phenomenon affecting both contamination and remediation in natural aqueous environments, including diffusion in groundwater aquitards and contaminated bed sediments. This study presents a new analytical solution for solute diffusion in a semi-infinite two-layer porous medium for arbitrary boundary and initial conditions. The solution was obtained by using the Green's function approach in the Laplace domain with the application of the binomial theorem to facilitate inversion back to the real time domain. Results based on this solution were found to be simple both in form and ease of calculation and to be in good agreement with those obtained using numerical calculations based on the Crank-Nicolson finite difference method. Applications of the solution are presented in the context of a contaminated groundwater aquitard to demonstrate how different boundary and initial conditions can greatly affect the contamination and decontamination of porous media, and to illustrate how diffusion modeling might be used in a forensic sense.},

Data truncation is a practical necessity of laboratory column experiments because of both time and detection-limit constraints. In this paper, we study the extent to which data truncation can affect estimates of transport modeling parameters, as derived from temporal moment calculations and in the context of solute transport experiments that are influenced by sorption and nonequilibrium partitioning among mobile and immobile phases. Our results show that, for a given amount of solute used, step changes in input conditions can give more accurate moment-derived parameters than Dirac or square-wave pulses, whereas Dirac and square-wave pulses are essentially identical in terms of accuracy of parameter estimates. By simulating data truncation for a wide range of column input and transport conditions, we provide guidance toward the experimental designs that are needed to keep parameter estimation error within specified bounds, assuming nonequilibrium conditions of transport that result from either first-order or diffusion-based rate processes. More specifically, we investigate the relationships between mass of solute added to the system, minimum solute quantification limits, experiment duration times, and accuracy of parameter estimation, all as a function of experimental conditions.},

Heterogeneity in naturally occurring carbonaceous materials (CMs) causes sorbed hydrophobic organic compound (HOC) concentrations in soils, sediments, and rocks to occur as a combination of surface adsorption and phase partitioning, with the latter typically more linearly dependent on aqueous concentration. In this manuscript, we describe a model to simulate HOC sorption as the combined effect of adsorption to thermally altered CM and a more linear solvation-driven absorption into gel-like CM (organic matter). We describe different forms of thermally altered CM (such as soots, chars, coals, and kerogen), the manner in which these materials can serve as especially strong adsorbents, and the conditions under which they can control solid-aqueous distribution. Specific examples of model fits to soil, sediment and rock samples with identified thermally altered CM components provide a linkage between sorption components and sorbent material properties. Because both the adsorption and partition components are scalable by compound solubility, it may often be possible to estimate nonlinear isotherms for a wide range of chemicals based on comparatively few experimental measurements. Thermally altered CM is widespread in the environment and can serve as an important sorbent even when present in small quantities (especially at low concentrations of adsorbates). In this context, the sorption modeling refinements described in this work are expected to have wide applicability. Given that solid/water distribution is a central process affecting contaminant fate, such refined models are an essential element for better estimates of risk and improved remediation design.},

The generalized integral transform technique (GITT) is applied to solve the one-dimensional advection-dispersion equation (ADE) in heterogeneous porous media coupled with either linear or nonlinear sorption and decay. When both sorption and decay are linear, analytical solutions are obtained using the GITT for one-dimensional ADEs with spatially and temporally variable flow and dispersion coefficient and arbitrary initial and boundary conditions. When either sorption or decay is nonlinear the solutions to ADEs with the GITT are hybrid analytical-numerical. In both linear and nonlinear cases, the forward and inverse integral transforms for the problems described in the paper are apparent and straightforward. Some illustrative examples with linear sorption and decay are presented to demonstrate the application and check the accuracy of the derived analytical solutions. The derived hybrid analytical-numerical solutions are checked against a numerical approach and demonstratively applied to a nonlinear transport example, which simulates a simplified system of iron oxide bioreduction with nonlinear sorption and nonlinear reaction kinetics.},

Bioavailability often controls the fate of organic contaminants in surface and subsurface aquatic environments. Bioavailability can be limited by sorption, mass transfer, and intrinsic biodegradation potential and can be further altered by the presence of other compounds. This paper reviews current perspectives on the processes influencing subsurface contaminant bioavailability, how these processes are modeled, and how the relative role of the various processes can be assessed through bioavailability indices. Although these processes are increasingly well understood, the use of sophisticated models and indices often are precluded by an inability to estimate the many parameters that are associated with complex models. Nonetheless, the proper representation of sorption, mass transfer, biodegradation, and co-solute effects can be critical in predicting bio-attenuation. The influence of these processes on contaminant fate is illustrated with numerical simulations for the simultaneous degradation of toluene (growth substrate) and trichloroethylene (nongrowth cometabolite) in hypothetical, aerobic, solid-water systems. The results show how the relative impacts on contaminant fate of the model's various component processes depends upon system conditions, including co-solute concentrations. Slow biodegradation rates increase the inhibition effects of a cometabolite and suppress the rate enhancement effects of a growth substrate. Irrespective of co-solute effects, contaminant fate is less sensitive to biodegradation processes in systems with strong sorption and slow desorption rates. Bioavailability indices can be used to relate these findings and to help identify appropriate modeling simplifications. In general, however, there remains a need to redefine such indices in order that bioavailability concepts can be better incorporated into site characterization, remediation design, and regulatory oversight.},
