abstract = {Natural production rates of the 16 million-year iodine-129 from spontaneous fission and from cosmic-ray reactions are estimated to contribute a steady-state concentration of more than 10-14 gram of I129 per gram of I129 to the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the biosphere. These concentrations are expected to be detectable by neutron-activation analysis in natural materials that concentrate iodine. Substantial additional contributions have been made by fission-produced I129 in fallout, serving as an intrinsic tracer for natural iodine kinetics. Iodine-129 activation analysis has advantages as a tracer technique.},

@article{Hu2008,
abstract = {Many long-lived radionuclides are present in groundwater at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) as a result of 828 underground nuclear weapons tests conducted between 1951 and 1992. In conjunction with a comprehensive geochemical review of radionuclides (3H, 14C, 36Cl, 99Tc and 129I) that are presumably mobile in the subsurface, we synthesized a body of radionuclide activity data measured from groundwater samples collected at 18 monitoring wells, to qualitatively assess their migration at the NTS over distances of hundreds of meters and over timescales of decades. Tritium and 36Cl showed little evidence of retardation, while the transport of 14C may have been retarded by its isotopic exchange with carbonate minerals in the aquifer. Observed local reducing conditions (either natural or test-induced) will impact the mobility of certain redox-sensitive radionuclides (especially 99Tc) that were otherwise soluble and readily transported under oxidizing conditions. Conversely, strongly oxidizing conditions may impact the mobility of 129I which is mobile under reducing conditions. The effect of iodine speciation on its transport deserves further attention. Indication of delayed transport of some "mobile" radionuclides (especially 99Tc) in the groundwater at the NTS suggested the importance of redox conditions of the natural system in controlling the fate and transport of radionuclides, which has implications in the enhanced performance of the potential Yucca Mountain repository, located adjacent to the NTS, to store high-level nuclear wastes as well as management of radionuclide contamination in legacy nuclear operations facilities.},

abstract = {Iodine is an important element in studies of environmental protection
and human health, global-scale hydrologic processes and nuclear nonproliferation.
Biogeochemical cycling of iodine is complex, because iodine occurs
in multiple oxidation states and as inorganic and organic species
that may be hydrophilic, atmophilic, and biophilic. In this study,
we applied new analytical techniques to study the sorption and transport
behavior of iodine species (iodide, iodate, and 4-iodoaniline) in
sediments collected at the Savannah River and Hanford Sites, where
anthropogenic 129I from prior nuclear fuel processing activities
poses an environmental risk. We conducted integrated column and batch
experiments to investigate the interconversion, sorption and transport
of iodine species, and the sediments we examined exhibit a wide range
in organic matter, clay mineralogy, soil pH, and texture. The results
of our experiments illustrate complex behavior with various processes
occurring, including iodate reduction, irreversible retention or
mass loss of iodide, and rate-limited and nonlinear sorption. There
was an appreciable iodate reduction to iodide, presumably mediated
by the structural Fe(II) in some clay minerals; therefore, careful
attention must be given to potential interconversion among species
when interpreting the biogeochemical behavior of iodine in the environment.
The different iodine species exhibited dramatically different sorption
and transport behavior in three sediment samples, possessing different
physico-chemical properties, collected from different depths at the
Savannah River Site. Our study yielded additional insight into processes
and mechanisms affecting the geochemical cycling of iodine in the
environment, and provided quantitative estimates of key parameters
(e.g., extent and rate of sorption) for risk assessment at these
sites.},
