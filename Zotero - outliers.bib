abstract = {Outlier detection has been used for centuries to detect and, where appropriate, remove anomalous observations from data. Outliers arise due to mechanical faults, changes in system behaviour, fraudulent behaviour, human error, instrument error or simply through natural deviations in populations. Their detection can identify system faults and fraud before they escalate with potentially catastrophic consequences. It can identify errors and remove their contaminating effect on the data set and as such to purify the data for processing. The original outlier detection methods were arbitrary but now, principled and systematic techniques are used, drawn from the full gamut of Computer Science and Statistics. In this paper, we introduce a survey of contemporary techniques for outlier detection. We identify their respective motivations and distinguish their advantages and disadvantages in a comparative review.},

abstract = {In the field of wireless sensor networks, those measurements that significantly deviate from the normal pattern of sensed data are considered as outliers. The potential sources of outliers include noise and errors, events, and malicious attacks on the network. Traditional outlier detection techniques are not directly applicable to wireless sensor networks due to the nature of sensor data and specific requirements and limitations of the wireless sensor networks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of existing outlier detection techniques specifically developed for the wireless sensor networks. Additionally, it presents a technique-based taxonomy and a comparative table to be used as a guideline to select a technique suitable for the application at hand based on characteristics such as data type, outlier type, outlier identity, and outlier degree.},

@article{Janeja2010,
abstract = {Success of anomaly detection, similar to other spatial data mining techniques, relies on neighborhood definition. In this paper, we argue that the anomalous behavior of spatial objects in a neighborhood can be truly captured when both (a) spatial autocorrelation (similar behavior of nearby objects due to proximity) and (b) spatial heterogeneity (distinct behavior of nearby objects due to difference in the underlying processes in the region) are taken into consideration for the neighborhood definition. Our approach begins by generating micro neighborhoods around spatial objects encompassing all the information about a spatial object. We selectively merge these based on spatial relationships accounting for autocorrelation and inferential relationships accounting for heterogeneity, forming macro neighborhoods. In such neighborhoods, we then identify (i) spatio-temporal outliers, where individual sensor readings are anomalous, (ii) spatial outliers, where the entire sensor is an anomaly, and (iii) spatio-temporally coalesced outliers, where a group of spatio-temporal outliers in the macro neighborhood are separated by a small time lag indicating the traversal of the anomaly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in neighborhood formation and anomaly detection with experimental results in (i) water monitoring and (ii) highway traffic monitoring sensor datasets. We also compare the results of our approach with an existing approach for spatial anomaly detection.},

abstract = {This work proposes a method for detecting distance-based outliers in data streams under the sliding window model. The novel notion of one-time outlier query is introduced in order to detect anomalies in the current window at arbitrary points-in-time. Three algorithms are presented. The first algorithm exactly answers to outlier queries, but has larger space requirements than the other two. The second algorithm is derived from the exact one, reduces memory requirements and returns an approximate answer based on estimations with a statistical guarantee. The third algorithm is a specialization of the approximate algorithm working with strictly fixed memory requirements. Accuracy properties and memory consumption of the algorithms have been theoretically assessed. Moreover experimental results have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the good quality of the solutions.},

abstract = {Outlier detection research has been seeing many new algorithms every year that often appear to be only slightly different from existing methods along with some experiments that show them to “clearly outperform” the others. However, few approaches come along with a clear analysis of existing methods and a solid theoretical differentiation. Here, we provide a formalized method of analysis to allow for a theoretical comparison and generalization of many existing methods. Our unified view improves understanding of the shared properties and of the differences of outlier detection models. By abstracting the notion of locality from the classic distance-based notion, our framework facilitates the construction of abstract methods for many special data types that are usually handled with specialized algorithms. In particular, spatial neighborhood can be seen as a special case of locality. Here we therefore compare and generalize approaches to spatial outlier detection in a detailed manner. We also discuss temporal data like video streams, or graph data such as community networks. Since we reproduce results of specialized approaches with our general framework, and even improve upon them, our framework provides reasonable baselines to evaluate the true merits of specialized approaches. At the same time, seeing spatial outlier detection as a special case of local outlier detection, opens up new potentials for analysis and advancement of methods.},

abstract = {We propose a new statistical approach to the problem of inlier-based outlier detection, i.e., finding outliers in the test set based on the training set consisting only of inliers. Our key idea is to use the ratio of training and test data densities as an outlier score. This approach is expected to have better performance even in high-dimensional problems since methods for directly estimating the density ratio without going through density estimation are available. Among various density ratio estimation methods, we employ the method called unconstrained least-squares importance fitting (uLSIF) since it is equipped with natural cross-validation procedures, allowing us to objectively optimize the value of tuning parameters such as the regularization parameter and the kernel width. Furthermore, uLSIF offers a closed-form solution as well as a closed-form formula for the leave-one-out error, so it is computationally very efficient and is scalable to massive datasets. Simulations with benchmark and real-world datasets illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.},

@article{Koufakou2010,
abstract = {Outlier detection has attracted substantial attention in many applications and research areas; some of the most prominent applications are network intrusion detection or credit card fraud detection. Many of the existing approaches are based on calculating distances among the points in the dataset. These approaches cannot easily adapt to current datasets that usually contain a mix of categorical and continuous attributes, and may be distributed among different geographical locations. In addition, current datasets usually have a large number of dimensions. These datasets tend to be sparse, and traditional concepts such as Euclidean distance or nearest neighbor become unsuitable. We propose a fast distributed outlier detection strategy intended for datasets containing mixed attributes. The proposed method takes into consideration the sparseness of the dataset, and is experimentally shown to be highly scalable with the number of points and the number of attributes in the dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed outlier detection method compares very favorably with other state-of-the art outlier detection strategies proposed in the literature and that the speedup achieved by its distributed version is very close to linear.},

abstract = {Outlier detection is an integral part of data mining and has attracted much attention recently [M. Breunig et al., (2000)], [W. Jin et al., (2001)], [E. Knorr et al., (2000)]. We propose a new method for evaluating outlierness, which we call the local correlation integral (LOCI). As with the best previous methods, LOCI is highly effective for detecting outliers and groups of outliers (a.k.a. micro-clusters). In addition, it offers the following advantages and novelties: (a) It provides an automatic, data-dictated cutoff to determine whether a point is an outlier-in contrast, previous methods force users to pick cut-offs, without any hints as to what cut-off value is best for a given dataset. (b) It can provide a LOCI plot for each point; this plot summarizes a wealth of information about the data in the vicinity of the point, determining clusters, micro-clusters, their diameters and their inter-cluster distances. None of the existing outlier-detection methods can match this feature, because they output only a single number for each point: its outlierness score, (c) Our LOCI method can be computed as quickly as the best previous methods, (d) Moreover, LOCI leads to a practically linear approximate method, aLOCI (for approximate LOCI), which provides fast highly-accurate outlier detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use approximate computations to speed up outlier detection. Experiments on synthetic and real world data sets show that LOCI and aLOCI can automatically detect outliers and micro-clusters, without user-required cut-offs, and that they quickly spot both expected and unexpected outliers.},

The rules that we propose have good performance under the null hypothesis of no outliers in the data and also appreciable power properties for the purpose of individual outlier detection. This achievement is made possible by two orders of improvement over the currently available methodology. First, we suggest an approximation to the exact distribution of robust distances from which cut-off values can be obtained even in small samples. Our thresholds are accurate, simple to implement and result in more powerful outlier identification rules than those obtained by calibrating the asymptotic distribution of distances. The second power improvement comes from the addition of a new iteration step after one-step reweighting of the estimator. The proposed methodology is motivated by asymptotic distributional results. Its finite sample performance is evaluated through simulations and compared to that of available multivariate outlier tests.},
