abstract = {Many methods can be used to test alternative ground water models. Of concern in this work are methods able to (1) rank alternative models (also called model discrimination) and (2) identify observations important to parameter estimates and predictions (equivalent to the purpose served by some types of sensitivity analysis). Some of the measures investigated are computationally efficient; others are computationally demanding. The latter are generally needed to account for model nonlinearity. The efficient model discrimination methods investigated include the information criteria: the corrected Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, and generalized cross-validation. The efficient sensitivity analysis measures used are dimensionless scaled sensitivity (DSS), composite scaled sensitivity, and parameter correlation coefficient (PCC); the other statistics are DFBETAS, Cook's D, and observation-prediction statistic. Acronyms are explained in the introduction. Cross-validation (CV) is a computationally intensive nonlinear method that is used for both model discrimination and sensitivity analysis. The methods are tested using up to five alternative parsimoniously constructed models of the ground water system of the Maggia Valley in southern Switzerland. The alternative models differ in their representation of hydraulic conductivity. A new method for graphically representing CV and sensitivity analysis results for complex models is presented and used to evaluate the utility of the efficient statistics. The results indicate that for model selection, the information criteria produce similar results at much smaller computational cost than CV. For identifying important observations, the only obviously inferior linear measure is DSS; the poor performance was expected because DSS does not include the effects of parameter correlation and PCC reveals large parameter correlations.},

@article{Meyer1988,
abstract = {A method is presented for locating wells in a monitoring network under conditions of uncertainty. The method couples the use of a simulation model of contaminant transport and a facility location model. The Monte Carlo technique is used with the simulation model to translate uncertainty in the simulation model parameters into uncertainty in the contaminant concentration distribution. The simulation model determines which well locations would detect a given realization of a contaminant plume with a concentration above a specified limit. The facility location model is then used to select a fixed number of well locations so that a maximum number of such plume realizations are detected. The selected well network maximizes the probability of detection. The method is applied to an example problem. Although the technique is computationally intensive, the results indicate that practical problems are tractable.},

@article{Tamea,
abstract = {Aim of this work is to propose a stochastic description of the leakage between two aquifers separated by a semi-permeable layer with low hydraulic conductivity. The source of uncertainty here considered is the random fluctuation of the phreatic surface of surficial aquifer, originated from random rainfall events. The study focuses on an area surrounding a pumping well penetrating the deep aquifer and impacting its piezometric level, where infiltration from the surficial aquifer can be more harmful. Closed form expressions for the leakage between the surficial and the deep aquifer are used to obtain the long-term probability distribution of leakage flow rate, assuming the shallow phreatic surface dynamics modeled with a Poisson-driven stochastic process. A sensitivity analysis is performed to verify the variability of the probability distribution of leakage within the range of feasible parameter values, then the stochastic model is applied to three field cases where time series of the piezometric levels of the phreatic aquifer are available. Results show that the induced variability of the discharge flowing between aquifers is remarkable and that in general it cannot be neglected despite the low hydraulic conductivity of the semi-permeable layer. The proposed probabilistic model is a useful tool for evaluating the risk associated to contaminant transport into deep aquifers and its fate in relation to groundwater withdrawals.},

@article{Oostrom,
abstract = {Abstract
A series of calculations and model predictions were used to evaluate the controls on perched-water conditions and constraints on perching occurrence, persistence, and potential impact on groundwater contamination. These simulations considered perched-water conditions that have been observed in the vadose zone above a fine-grained layer located just a few meters above the water table beneath the B-Complex Tank Farms area at the Hanford Site. The perched water, containing elevated concentrations of uranium and technetium-99, is important to consider in evaluating the future flux of contaminated water into the groundwater. A study was conducted to examine the perched-water conditions and quantitatively evaluate 1) factors that control perching behavior, 2) contaminant flux toward groundwater, and, 3) associated groundwater impact. Based on the current vertical transport pathways and large areal extent of the perched system, the evaluation was conducted using a one-dimensional analysis. Steady-state analytical calculations showed that the perching-layer hydraulic conductivity is likely to be up to two orders of magnitude lower than the value obtained from Hanford site material property estimates. Numerical flow and transport simulations provided both steady-state and transient system estimates of water and contaminant behavior and were used to further refine the range of conditions consistent with current observations of perched water height and to provide estimates of future water and contaminant flux to groundwater. Near-term removal of perched water by pumping can decrease the total contaminant mass that will discharge to the groundwater, but will have only a moderate effect on the near-term discharge rate and corresponding contaminant concentration in groundwater. Combining pumping with a decrease in the recharge rate will be most effective in minimizing the impact to groundwater. These results provide a framework for constraining the behavior of perched aquifer systems especially related to impacts on contaminant transport.},

@article{Ye2010,
abstract = {This study evaluates alternative groundwater models with different recharge and geologic components at the northern Yucca Flat area of the Death Valley Regional Flow System (DVRFS), USA. Recharge over the DVRFS has been estimated using five methods, and five geological interpretations are available at the northern Yucca Flat area. Combining the recharge and geological components together with additional modeling components that represent other hydrogeological conditions yields a total of 25 groundwater flow models. As all the models are plausible given available data and information, evaluating model uncertainty becomes inevitable. On the other hand, hydraulic parameters (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) are uncertain in each model, giving rise to parametric uncertainty. Propagation of the uncertainty in the models and model parameters through groundwater modeling causes predictive uncertainty in model predictions (e.g., hydraulic head and flow). Parametric uncertainty within each model is assessed using Monte Carlo simulation, and model uncertainty is evaluated using the model averaging method. Two model-averaging techniques (on the basis of information criteria and GLUE) are discussed. This study shows that contribution of model uncertainty to predictive uncertainty is significantly larger than that of parametric uncertainty. For the recharge and geological components, uncertainty in the geological interpretations has more significant effect on model predictions than uncertainty in the recharge estimates. In addition, weighted residuals vary more for the different geological models than for different recharge models. Most of the calibrated observations are not important for discriminating between the alternative models, because their weighted residuals vary only slightly from one model to another.},

@article{Haddad,
abstract = {The complexity of mass transfer processes between the mobile and immobile zones in geohydrologic settings and the limitations that currently exist in the characterization of contaminated sites demand the development of improved models. In this work, we present a model that describes the mass transfer in structured porous media. This model considers divergent radial advective-dispersive transport in fractures and diffusive mass transfer inside rock matrix blocks. The heterogeneous nature of fractured formations is included with the integration of various distributions of rock matrix block sizes into the transport model. Breakthrough curves generated based on the developed model are analyzed to investigate the effects of the rate of injection, dispersivity and the immobile to mobile porosity ratio on mass transfer between mobile and immobile zones. It is shown that the developed model, in conjunction with tracer data collected from a monitoring well, can be used to estimate the dispersivity and fracture intensity. Results reveal that the dispersivity is independent of the rock matrix block size distribution for dispersion-dominant transport in fractures. These findings are used to develop a methodology to characterize rock matrix block size distribution in fractured aquifers and to estimate dispersivity based on a tracer test, which will improve our decisions concerning the remediation of contaminated sites.},
