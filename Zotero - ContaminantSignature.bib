abstract = {A field survey was carried out soon after the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. Gamma-ray emitting radionuclides and plutonium isotopes in a series of soil samples collected from the heavily contaminated areas outside the 20-km exclusion zone, as well as from Okuma Town adjacent to the plant, were measured. Volatile radionuclides such as 131I, 134Cs, and 137Cs contributed largely to the released radioactivity. Higher depositions of these nuclides were observed in areas to the northwestern- including Okuma Town and Iitate Village, which is at a distance of 25-45 km from the plant. The results obtained were consistent with the levels and distributions estimated later by the Japan-USA joint-survey (Asahi Shimbun Company, 2011). Trace amounts of plutonium isotopes originating from the accident were detected mainly in soil samples from Iitate Village and in limited soil samples from Okuma Town. The detected levels of 239,240Pu contamination due to the accident were considered to be less than a millionth those of the 137Cs contamination. Â© 2012 by The Geochemical Society of Japan.},

abstract = {Dust samples from the sides of roads (black substances) have been collected together with litter and soil samples at more than 100 sites contaminated heavily in the 20-km exclusion zones around Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) (Minamisoma City, and Namie, Futaba and Okuma Towns), in Iitate Village located from 25 to 45 km northwest of the plant and in southern areas from the plant. Isotopes of Pu, Am and Cm have been measured in the samples to evaluate their total releases into the environment from the FDNPP and to get the isotopic compositions among these nuclides. For black substances and litter samples, in addition to Pu isotopes, 241Am, 242Cm and 243,244Cm were determined for most of samples examined, while for soil samples, only Pu isotopes were determined. The results provided a coherent data set on 239,240Pu inventories and isotopic composition among these transuranic nuclides. When these activity ratios were compared with those for fuel core inventories in the FDNPP accident estimated by a group at JAEA, except 239,240Pu/137Cs activity ratios, fairly good agreements were found, indicating that transuranic nuclides, probably in the forms of fine particles, were released into the environment without their large fractionations. The obtained data may lead to more accurate information about the on-site situation (e.g., burn-up, conditions of fuel during the release phase, etc.), which would be difficult to get otherwise, and more detailed information on the dispersion and deposition processes of transuranic nuclides and the behavior of these nuclides in the environment.},

@article{Srivastava2014,
abstract = {Contamination of groundwater constrains its uses and poses a serious threat to the environment. Once groundwater is contaminated, the cleanup may be difficult and expensive. Identification of unknown pollution sources is the first step toward adopting any remediation strategy. The proposed methodology exploits the capability of a universal function approximation by a feed-forward multilayer artificial neural network (ANN) to identify the sources in terms of its location, magnitudes, and duration of activity. The back-propagation algorithm is utilized for training the ANN to identify the source characteristics based on simulated concentration data at specified observation locations in the aquifer. Uniform random generation and the Latin hypercube sampling method of random generation are used to generate temporal varying source fluxes. These source fluxes are used in groundwater flow and the transport simulation model to generate necessary data for the ANN model-building processes. Breakthrough curves obtained for the specified pollution scenario are characterized by different methods. The characterized breakthrough curves parameters serve as inputs to ANN model. Unknown pollution source characteristics are outputs for ANN model. Experimentation is also performed with different number of training and testing patterns. In addition, the effects of measurement errors in concentration measurements values are used to show the robustness of ANN based methodology for source identification in case of erroneous data.},

@article{PinderIII2014,
abstract = {Data from published studies and World Wide Web sources were combined to produce and test a regression model to predict Cs concentration ratios for freshwater fish species. The accuracies of predicted concentration ratios, which were computed using 1) species trophic levels obtained from random resampling of known food items and 2) K concentrations in the water for 207 fish from 44 species and 43 locations, were tested against independent observations of ratios for 57 fish from 17 species from 25 locations. Accuracy was assessed as the percent of observed to predicted ratios within factors of 2 or 3. Conservatism, expressed as the lack of under prediction, was assessed as the percent of observed to predicted ratios that were less than 2 or less than 3. The model's median observed to predicted ratio was 1.26, which was not significantly different from 1, and 50\% of the ratios were between 0.73 and 1.85. The percentages of ratios within factors of 2 or 3 were 67 and 82\%, respectively. The percentages of ratios that were <2 or <3 were 79 and 88\%, respectively. An example for Perca fluviatilis demonstrated that increased prediction accuracy could be obtained when more detailed knowledge of diet was available to estimate trophic level.},

abstract = {This work applies optimization and an Eulerian inversion approach presented by Bagtzoglou and Baun in 2005 in order to reconstruct contaminant plume time histories and to identify the likely source of atmospheric contamination using data from a real test site for the first time. Present-day distribution of an atmospheric contaminant plume as well as data points reflecting the plume history allow the reconstruction and provide the plume velocity, distribution, and probable source. The method was tested to a hypothetical case and with data from the Forest Atmosphere Transfer and Storage (FACTS) experiment in the Duke experimental forest site. In the scenarios presented herein, as well as in numerous cases tested for verification purposes, the model conserved mass, successfully located the peak of the plume, and managed to capture the motion of the plume well but underestimated the contaminant peak.},

@article{Sakaguchi2012,
abstract = {Concentrations of the radionuclides, U, Pu, and Cs were measured in water samples (10-20 L) to study analyte dispersion and migration following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident. A total of 8 water samples including oceanic water and paddy-field water were collected in the vicinity of the plant. Determinations of U, Pu and Cs isotopes were performed by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and $\gamma$-ray spectrometry. The 236U/ 238U atom ratio was in the range 1.83-8.20 Ã 10-9 for fresh water and around 0.57 Ã 10-9 for seawater while the concentration of 236U was about 104-105 and 106 atoms/kg, respectively. Plutonium (239-240Pu) was detected in one riverine sample and the marine samples at very low levels and with large uncertainty. The concentrations of 137Cs in fresh riverine samples were 0.02-0.46 Bq/kg which are more than three orders of magnitude larger than the global fallout level. As for seawater samples within 80 km offshore of the FDNPP, the concentrations of 137Cs were 10-20 times higher than that of the Japan Sea water. Also 134Cs and 137Cs were of similar concentrations in all samples. The results show that volatile and refractory nuclides such as Cs, U and Pu exist in the dissolved phase, which can be readily assimilated by plants/humans. However the environmental impact of Pu and U in the vicinity of the FDNPP is considered to be low in comparison to that of the volatile radionuclide Cs. Â© 2012 by The Geochemical Society of Japan.},

abstract = {An integrated domestic well sampling and âsusceptibility assessmentâ programme was undertaken in the Republic of Ireland from April 2008 to November 2010. Overall, 211 domestic wells were sampled, assessed and collated with local climate data. Based upon groundwater physicochemical profile, three clusters have been identified and characterized by source type (borehole or hand-dug well) and local geological setting. Statistical analysis indicates that cluster membership is significantly associated with the prevalence of bacteria (p = 0.001), with mean E. coli presence within clusters ranging from 15.4\% (Cluster-1) to 47.6\% (Cluster-3). Bivariate risk factor analysis shows that on-site septic tank presence was the only risk factor significantly associated (p < 0.05) with bacterial presence within all clusters. Point agriculture adjacency was significantly associated with both borehole-related clusters. Well design criteria were associated with hand-dug wells and boreholes in areas characterized by high permeability subsoils, while local geological setting was significant for hand-dug wells and boreholes in areas dominated by low/moderate permeability subsoils. Multivariate susceptibility models were developed for all clusters, with predictive accuracies of 84\% (Cluster-1) to 91\% (Cluster-2) achieved. Septic tank setback was a common variable within all multivariate models, while agricultural sources were also significant, albeit to a lesser degree. Furthermore, well liner clearance was a significant factor in all models, indicating that direct surface ingress is a significant well contamination mechanism. Identification and elucidation of cluster-specific contamination mechanisms may be used to develop improved overall risk management and wellhead protection strategies, while also informing future remediation and maintenance efforts.},
