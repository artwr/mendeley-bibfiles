abstract = {The flow duration curve (FDC) can provide information about the integral catchment response to rainfall events that span from low volume events to events of flood magnitude, and the FDC is particularly useful for low flow regime characterization. The focus of this study was to introduce a statistical, parsimonious approach with a conceptually based parameterization that can lead to simple and practical tools for FDC predictions that can be applied to contexts, such as the Mediterranean climate, that involve scarce data and regional geological and hydro-geological features that strongly affect low-flow hydrological regimes. At-site, dimensionless, empirical FDCs were represented with three-parameter log normal distributions, the variations in the corresponding parameters versus the base flow index (BFI) were explored, and the conceptual relationship of these parameters is further discussed. In cases of ungauged catchments for which the BFI is not known, a priori estimates of such indices can be derived from permeability indices, as BFIs are strongly related to permeability indices in the studied region (Longobardi and Villani, 2008). For moderate to large permeability catchments, which represent the largest fraction of the investigated catchments, prediction errors associated with the proposed regional method of FDC assessment, which is particularly suited for regions for which only scarce or poor data are available, averaged approximately 18\%.},

abstract = {Disinfection contactors are frequently characterized using tracer studies to determine macromixing patterns. For some applications, such as compliance with the surface water treatment rule, this information can be interpreted directly without much analysis. However, when tracer studies are performed to characterize residence time distributions for design purposes, this information is frequently analyzed using a method of moments approach. This paper shows that the method of moments approach, when compared to a nonlinear regression approach, produces a biased estimate of mean residence time and dimensionless variance, and one with a greater mean square error. The amount of bias in moments estimators is significant in a numerical sense, and leads to qualitatively poor estimation of the resulting residence time distribution. Examples are given of characterization of a pilot-scale chlorine contactor and a pilot-scale ozone contactor.},

abstract = {Abstract
Headwater stream, draining from a rural catchment in NW Spain, was sampled during baseflow and storm-event conditions to investigate the temporal variability in dissolved and particulate Al, Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn concentrations and the role of discharge (Q), pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and suspended sediment (SS) in the transport of dissolved and particulate metals. Under baseflow and storm-event conditions, concentrations of the five metals were highly variable. The results of this study reveal that all metal concentrations are correlated with SS. DOC and SS appeared to influence both the metal concentrations and the partitioning of metals between dissolved and particulate. The SS was a good predictor of particulate metal levels. Distribution coefficients (KD) were similar between metals (4.72–6.55) and did not change significantly as a function of discharge regime. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis reveals that the most important variable to explain storm-event KD for Al and Fe is DOC. The positive relationships found between metals, in each fraction, indicate that these elements mainly come from the same source. Metal concentrations in the stream were relatively low.},

abstract = {Abstract
Quantifying sediment supply from estuarine tributaries is an important component of developing a sediment budget, and common techniques for estimating supply are based on gages located above tidal influence. However, tidal interactions near tributary mouths can affect the magnitude and direction of sediment supply to the open waters of the estuary. We investigated suspended-sediment dynamics in the tidal reach of Corte Madera Creek, an estuarine tributary of San Francisco Bay, using moored acoustic and optical instruments. Flux of both water and suspended-sediment were calculated from observed water velocity and turbidity for two periods in each of wet and dry seasons during 2010. During wet periods, net suspended-sediment flux was seaward; tidally filtered flux was dominated by the advective component. In contrast, during dry periods, net flux was landward; tidally filtered flux was dominated by the dispersive component. The mechanisms generating this landward flux varied; during summer we attributed wind–wave resuspension in the estuary and subsequent transport on flood tides, whereas during autumn we attributed increased spring tide flood velocity magnitude leading to local resuspension. A quadrant analysis similar to that employed in turbulence studies was developed to summarize flux time series by quantifying the relative importance of sediment transport events. These events are categorized by the direction of velocity (flood vs. ebb) and the magnitude of concentration relative to tidally averaged conditions (relatively turbid vs. relatively clear). During wet periods, suspended-sediment flux was greatest in magnitude during relatively turbid ebbs, whereas during dry periods it was greatest in magnitude during relatively turbid floods. A conceptual model was developed to generalize seasonal differences in suspended-sediment dynamics; model application to this study demonstrated the importance of few, relatively large events on net suspended-sediment flux. These results suggest that other estuarine tributaries may alternate seasonally as sediment sinks or sources, leading to the conclusion that calculations of estuary sediment supply from local tributaries that do not account for tidal reaches may be overestimates.},

@article{Warrick2013,
abstract = {Summary
Time-dependencies of suspended-sediment discharge from six coastal watersheds of northern California – Smith River, Klamath River, Trinity River, Redwood Creek, Mad River, and Eel River – were evaluated using monitoring data from 1955 to 2010. Suspended-sediment concentrations revealed time-dependent hysteresis and multi-year trends. The multi-year trends had two primary patterns relative to river discharge: (i) increases in concentration resulting from both land clearing from logging and the flood of record during December 1964 (water year 1965), and (ii) continual decreases in concentration during the decades following this flood. Data from the Eel River revealed that changes in suspended-sediment concentrations occurred for all grain-size fractions, but were most pronounced for the sand fraction. Because of these changes, the use of bulk discharge-concentration relationships (i.e., “sediment rating curves”) without time-dependencies in these relationships resulted in substantial errors in sediment load estimates, including 2.5-fold over-prediction of Eel River sediment loads since 1979. We conclude that sediment discharge and sediment discharge relationships (such as sediment rating curves) from these coastal rivers have varied substantially with time in response to land use and climate. Thus, the use of historical river sediment data and sediment rating curves without considerations for time-dependent trends may result in significant errors in sediment yield estimates from the globally-important steep, small watersheds.},

abstract = {This paper argues that there are fundamental problems in the application of physically-based models for practical prediction in hydrology. These problems result from limitations of the model equations relative to a heterogeneous reality; the lack of a theory of subgrid scale integration; practical constraints on solution methodologies; and problems of dimensionality in parameter calibration. It is suggested that most current applications of physically-based models use them as lumped conceptual models at the grid scale. Recent papers on physically-based models have misunderstood and misrepresented these limitations. There are practical hydrological problems requiring physically-based predictions, and there will continue to be a need for physically-based models but ideas about their capabilities must change so that future applications attempt to obtain realistic estimates of the uncertainty associated with their predictions, particularly in the case of evaluating future scenarios of the effects of management strategies.},

abstract = {A framework is provided for scaling and scale issues in hydrology. The first section gives some basic definitions. This is important as researchers do not seem to have agreed on the meaning of concepts such as scale or upscaling. ‘Process scale’, ‘observation scale’ and ‘modelling (working) scale’ require different definitions. The second section discusses heterogeneity and variability in catchments and touches on the implications of randomness and organization for scaling. The third section addresses the linkages across scales from a modelling point of view. It is argued that up- scaling typically consists of two steps: distributing and aggregating. Conversely, downscaling involves disaggregation and singling out. Different approaches are discussed for linking state variables, parameters, inputs and conceptual- izations across scales. This section also deals with distributed parameter models, which are one way of linking con- ceptualizations across scales. The fourth section addresses the linkages across scales from a more holistic perspective dealing with dimensional analysis and similarity concepts. The main difference to the modelling point of view is that dimensional analysis and similarity concepts deal with complex processes in a much simpler fashion. Examples of dimensional analysis, similarity analysis and functional normalization in catchment hydrology are given. This section also briefly discusses fractals, which are a popular tool for quantifying variability across scales. The fifth section focuses on one particular aspect of this holistic view, discussing stream network analysis. The paper concludes with identifying key issues and gives some directions for future research.},

abstract = {Solute distributions within a soil profile during the leaching of water-soluble salts applied to the soil surface were measured at six depths to 182.4 cm within 20 subplots of a 150-ha field. Estimates of the pore water velocity based upon measures of solute displacement within each subplot and the entire field were found to be logarithmically normally distributed and in agreement with volumetric measures of water infiltration rates. Such agreement was only possible because it was recognized that the observed values were not normally distributed, and their mean values were calculated accordingly. The number of observations required to yield an estimate of the mean pore water velocity within a prescribed accuracy is shown to depend upon the nature and extent of the spatial variability of the field soil. For the field examined, 100 observations would allow the mean pore water velocity to be estimated within ±50\% of its true value. The functional relation between field-measured values of the apparent diffusion coefficient, also found to be logarithmically normally distributed, and pore water velocity is examined and interpreted in terms of solute distributions likely to be measured at specific sampling sites.},

abstract = {Predictive error variance analysis attempts to determine how wrong predictions made by a calibrated model may be. Predictive error variance analysis is usually undertaken following calibration using a small number of parameters defined through a priori parsimony. In contrast, we introduce a method for investigating the potential error in predictions made by highly parameterized models calibrated using regularized inversion. Vecchia and Cooley (1987) describe a method of predictive error variance analysis that is constrained by calibration data. We extend this approach to include constraints on parameters that lie within the calibration null space. These constraints are determined by dividing parameter space into combinations of parameters for which estimates can be obtained and those for which they cannot. This enables the contribution to predictive error variance from parameterization simplifications required to solve the inverse problem to be quantified, in addition to the contribution from measurement noise. We also describe a novel technique that restricts the analysis to a strategically defined predictive solution subspace, enabling an approximate predictive error variance analysis to be completed efficiently. The method is illustrated using a synthetic and a real-world groundwater flow and transport model.},

abstract = {The unsatisfactory state of hydrology is, in the final analysis, the result of the dichotomy between the theoretical recognition of hydrology as a science in its own right and the practical impossibility of studying it as a primary discipline but only as an appendage of hydraulic engineering, geography, geology, etc. As a consequence, the perspectives of hydrologists tend to be heavily biased in the direction of their nonhydrologic primary disciplines and their hydrologic backgrounds have wide gaps which breed a large variety of misconceptions. This state of affairs often paralyzes hydrologists' ability to differentiate between hydrology and water management, hydrology and statistics, facts and assumptions, science and convenience, etc., with consequent dangers both to scientific development of hydrology and to its practical utility. The danger increases with the proliferation of computerized “hydrologic” models whose cheaply arranged ability to fit data is presented as proof of their soundness and as a justification for using them for user-attractive but hydrologically indefensible extrapolations. These points are illustrated, among other things, by discussion of flood frequency analysis. The paper concludes with some thoughts concerning minimum standards for the testing of hydrologic simulation models that would ensure at least a modest level of credibility, and with a few suggestions for ingredients of a long-term cure that can prevent hydrology from joining alchemy and astrology in the annals of dilettantism.},

@article{O'Brien2013,
abstract = {Quantifying the proportion of the river hydrograph derived from the different hydrological pathways is essential for understanding the behaviour of a catchment. This paper describes a new approach using the output from Master Recession Curve (MRC) analysis to inform a new algorithm based on the Lyne and Hollick ‘one-parameter’ signal analysis filtering algorithm. This approach was applied to six catchments (including two subcatchments of these) in Ireland. The conceptual model for each catchment consists of four main flow pathways: overland flow, interflow, shallow groundwater and deep groundwater. The results were compared with those of the MRC analysis, a recharge coefficient approach developed in Ireland and the semi-distributed, lumped and deterministic hydrological model NAM. The new algorithm removes the ‘free variable’ aspect that is typically associated with filtering algorithms and provides a means of estimating the contribution of each pathway that is consistent with the results of hydrograph separation in catchments that are dominated by quick response pathways. These types of catchments are underlain by poorly productive aquifers that are not capable of providing large baseflows in the river. Such aquifers underlie over 73\% of Ireland, ensuring that this new algorithm is applicable in the majority of catchments in Ireland and potentially in those catchments internationally that are strongly influenced by the quick-responding hydrological pathways.

abstract = {Current and projected UK activities with the Syst\`{e}me Hydrologique Europ\'{e}en (SHE) hydrological modelling system are examined. Development of the SHE arose from the need for a new modelling approach for use in assessing the environmental impacts of river basin development and the system is particularly suited to predicting the impacts of land use and climatic changes and to applications to basins with sparse data sets. the basic hydrology model is now being developed into a powerful contaminant and sediment transport modelling system called SHETRAN-UK and components are also being proposed to account for landslide and gully erosion. Applications of the SHE have been made at spatial scales ranging from 30 m2 to 5000 km2 and in a variety of environments. These have demonstrated an ability to achieve calibration on the basis of short time series records and field evaluation of parameters, to provide multiple outputs on a spatially and temporally distributed basis, and to explore basin response mechanisms. They have also indicated the importance of integrating field measurements within the calibration process. the effect of the scale of model grids on parameter evaluation and on simulation results still needs to be investigated and there is a need for field process studies in areas where there is a poor understanding, to improve certain of the process representations within the SHE. However, new ideas are being explored to account for subgrid spatial variability in parameter values and to develop a validation methodology for testing the predictive capability of the SHE. Future developments will include the use of geographical information systems and data processing packages to aid data handling, expert systems to improve the efficiency of calibration, and parallel processing and other new computational techniques. an expanding range of applications will see physically based hydrological modelling systems at the core of decision support systems and integrated at the continental scale with general circulation modelling systems.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Hydrologic variables are related through a complex set of dynamic processes. Due to this complexity, empirical, usually statistical, models are used for the synthesis of records or extentions of short-term data. Two statistical models applied are the power function and the exponential function of a hydrologic variable expressed in terms of streamflow. Parameters are usually estimated using least squares analysis on a linear relationship between a logarithmic transformation of the variables. This procedure produces biased results when used to predict an individual value or the long-term mean. Assuming the errors of the linear model are normally distributed, the bias is derived and is shown to result from the inverse transformation process. For cases where the errors are not normal, a nonparametric approach is used to estimate the bias. Evaluation of the implications for water quality, sediment and streamflow forecasting show the magnitude of the bias to vary with the particular application and to be significant in a few cases. Use of this simple technique for sediment discharge did not provide accurate results and should be questioned in general. Since no general conclusions can be drawn from this study as to when the bias is significant, evaluation in each situation is recommended as standard practice in hydrologic regression when a transformation is applied.},

abstract = {Summary 
Developing a hydrological forecasting model based on past records is crucial to effective hydropower reservoir management and scheduling. Traditionally, time series analysis and modeling is used for building mathematical models to generate hydrologic records in hydrology and water resources. Artificial intelligence (AI), as a branch of computer science, is capable of analyzing long-series and large-scale hydrological data. In recent years, it is one of front issues to apply AI technology to the hydrological forecasting modeling. In this paper, autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) models, artificial neural networks (ANNs) approaches, adaptive neural-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) techniques, genetic programming (GP) models and support vector machine (SVM) method are examined using the long-term observations of monthly river flow discharges. The four quantitative standard statistical performance evaluation measures, the coefficient of correlation (R), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (E), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), are employed to evaluate the performances of various models developed. Two case study river sites are also provided to illustrate their respective performances. The results indicate that the best performance can be obtained by ANFIS, GP and SVM, in terms of different evaluation criteria during the training and validation phases.},
