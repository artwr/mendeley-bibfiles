@article{Flach2004,
abstract = {Subgrid modeling of some type is typically used to account for heterogeneity at scales below the grid scale. The single-domain model (SDM), employing field-scale dispersion, and the dual-domain model (DDM), employing local hydrodynamic dispersion and exchange between domains having large hydraulic conductivity contrasts, are well-known examples. In this paper, the two modeling approaches are applied to tritium migration from the H-area seepage basins to a nearby stream--Fourmile Branch--at the Savannah River Site. This location has been monitored since 1955, so an extensive dataset exists for formulating realistic simulations and comparing the results to data. It is concluded that the main parameters of both models are scale-dependent, and methods are discussed for making initial estimates of the DDM parameters, which include mobile/immobile porosities and the mass exchange coefficient. Both models were calibrated to produce the best fit to recorded tritium data. When various attributes of the dataset were considered, including cumulative tritium activity discharged to Fourmile Branch, plume arrival time, and plume attenuation due to closure of the seepage basins in 1988, the DDM produced results superior to the SDM, while causing no unrealistic upgradient dispersion. A sensitivity analysis showed that only the DDM was able to accurately produce both the instantaneous activity discharge and cumulative activity with a single parameter set. This is thought to be due to the advection-dominated nature of transport in natural porous media and the more realistic treatment of this type of transport in the DDM relative to the SDM.},

abstract = {This work presents a comparative assessment of efficient uncertainty modeling techniques, including Stochastic Response Surface Method (SRSM) and High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR). This assessment considers improvement achieved with respect to conventional techniques of modeling uncertainty (Monte Carlo). Given that traditional methods for characterizing uncertainty are very computationally demanding, when they are applied in conjunction with complex environmental fate and transport models, this study aims to assess how accurately these efficient (and hence viable) techniques for uncertainty propagation can capture complex model output uncertainty. As a part of this effort, the efficacy of HDMR, which has primarily been used in the past as a model reduction tool, is also demonstrated for uncertainty analysis. The application chosen to highlight the accuracy of these new techniques is the steady state analysis of the groundwater flow in the Savannah River Site General Separations Area (GSA) using the subsurface Flow And Contaminant Transport (FACT) code. Uncertain inputs included three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity fields, and a two-dimensional recharge rate field. The output variables under consideration were the simulated stream baseflows and hydraulic head values. Results show that the uncertainty analysis outcomes obtained using SRSM andHDMRare practically indistinguishable from those obtained using the conventional Monte Carlo method, while requiring orders of magnitude fewer model simulations.},

@article{Dai2002a,
abstract = {The isotopic composition, size distribution, and redox speciation of plutonium (Pu) in the groundwater in the vicinity of the F-area seepage basins at the U.S. Department of Energy Savannah River Site (SRS) were examined. A low 240Pu/239Pu ratio in the upstream control well signifies a Pu source otherthan global fallout and indicates reactor-produced Pu. Elevated 240Pu/239Pu atom ratios downstream from the seepage basins are due to the decay of transplutonium isotopes, mainly 244Cm to 240Pu, which were generated at the SRS. Evidence suggests that the migration of basin-released Pu isotopes is minor. Rather, it is the transplutonium isotopes that migrate preferentially downstream and in the process decay to yield progeny Pu isotopes. Size fractionation studies with cross-flow ultrafiltration show that <4\% of the 239Pu or 240Pu is found in the colloidal fraction, a finding that is consistent with the higher Pu oxidation states observed in the SRS groundwater. The observation of a low abundance of colloid-associated Pu in SRS groundwater cannot be extrapolated to all sites, but is in contrast to the conclusions of prior groundwater Pu studies at the SRS and elsewhere. This work is unique in its application of a novel combination of sampling and processing protocols as well as its use of thermal ionization mass spectrometry for the detection of Pu isotopes. This allows quantification of the Pu source terms and better determination of the ambient Pu size and redox speciation representative of in situ conditions.},

@techreport{Murphy1993,
abstract = {Radionuclide concentrations were measured in soil and vegetation growing adjacent to and in the Savannah River Laboratory Seepage Basins as part of the plan for closure of the basin system. The results of the measurements provide some information about the mobility of the radionuclides introduced into the basins. \{sup 90\}Sr is the most mobile of the radionuclides in soil. Its high mobility and high relative uptake by vegetation cause \{sup 90\}Sr to be distributed throughout the basin system. \{sup 137\}Cs is not as mobile in the basin soil, limiting its uptake by vegetation growing on the edge of the seepage basins; however, it is readily taken up by the vegetation growing in the basins. Soil mobility and vegetation uptake is relatively low for all of the transuranic radionuclides. For the most part these radionuclides remain near the surface of the basin soils where they were absorbed from the waste-water. The relative role of soil mobility and vegetation uptake on the distribution of radionuclide at the basins was futher evaluated by comparing the vegetation concentration ratio and the half-depth of penetration of the radionuclides in the basin soil. The results suggest that vegetation processes dominate in determining the concentration of \{sup 60\}Co and \{sup 137\}Cs in the vegetation. The influences of soil and vegetation are more balanced for \{sup 90\}Sr. The other radionuclides exhibit both low soil mobility and low vegetation uptake. The lack of soil mobility is seen in the lower concentrations found in vegetation growing on the edge of the basin compared to those growing in the basin.},

The earlier documents describe the environmental cortsequences of tritium, iodine, and uranium.Documentson plutonium,strontium,carbon, and technetiumwill bepublished inthe future.These aredynamicdocuments andcurrent plans call for revising and updatingeach one on a two-year schedule. Radiocesium exists in the environmentas aresult of above-groundnuclearweapons tests, the Chemobyl accident, the destruction of satellite Cosmos 954, small releases from reactors and reprocessing plants, and the operationof industrial, medical, andeducational facilities. Radiocesium has been produced at SRS during the operation of five production reactors. Several hundred curies of \_TCswas releasedinto streams inthe late 50s and 60s from leaking fuel elements.Smaller quantities were released from the fuel reprocessing operations. About 1400 Ci of 137Cswas released to seepage basins where itwas tightly bound by clay in the soil.A much smaller quantity, about four Ci, was released to the atmosphere. Radiocesium concentration andtransport mechanisms for atmospheric, surface water, and groundwater have been extensively studied by Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) and ecological mechanisms have been studied by Savannah River Ecology Laboratory (SREL). The overall radiological impact of SRS releases on the offsite maximum individual can be characterizedby total doses of 0.33 mrem(atmospheric) and 60 mrem(liquid),compared with a dose of 12,960 mrem from non-SRS soures during the same period of time. Isotope 137Cs releases have resulted in a negligible risk to the environment and the population it supports.},

abstract = {A comprehensive Composite Analysis (CA) has been performed considering 152 sources of residual radioactive material at the Savannah River Site (SRS). As part of the CA a model was developed to perform deterministic base case calculations using the commercial GoldSim software. The model treated transport and decay of radionuclides as they are released at the source location and transported through the source region, vadose zone and aquifer to stream outcrops and from there to the Savannah River. A dose to the public was calculated assuming recreational use of stream water and residential use of river water. The specific results from the GoldSim modeling evaluation conducted as part of the CA indicate that the collective maximum dose resulting from the release of radionuclides from all 152 anticipated SRS End State sources of residual radionuclides demonstrate that maximum exposures expected to occur to any offsite MOP will not approach the 300 uSv/yr (30 mrem/yr) dose constraint, and in fact are currently estimated to be only 10\% of this. For each of the POA’s evaluated, the highest cumulative dose is realized at the Lower Three Runs POA and is calculated to be 29.7 uSv/yr (2.97 mrem/yr). The major dose contributing radionuclide for all of the POA’s, with the exception of Upper Three Runs, was 137Cs in the contaminated streambed sediments. In Upper Three Runs 237Np from the H-Area Canyon Building was the major dose contributing radionuclide. The major exposure pathway for the SRS streams (where the Recreational Scenario was evaluated) was by the ingestion of fish. In the Savannah River, where the Residential Scenario was evaluated, ingestion of vegetation was the dominant exposure pathway. The uncertainty evaluation lends added assurance to the conclusion that the 30 mrem/yr dose constraint will not be exceeded, in that even at the 95’th Percentile, this performance measure is not expected to be exceeded. It must also be added that these conclusions should be regarded as “preliminary” since the DOE review process of the SRS CA has not yet been completed.},

abstract = {Field and laboratory studies were carried out to understand the cause for steady increases in (129)I concentrations emanating from radiological basins located on the Savannah River Site, South Carolina. The basins were closed in 1988 by adding limestone and slag and then capping with a low permeability engineered cover. Groundwater (129)I concentrations in a well near the basins in 1993 were 200 pCi L(-1) and are presently between 400 and 1000 pCi L(-1). Iodine speciation in the plume contained wide ranges of iodide, iodate, and organo-iodine concentrations. First-order calculations based on a basin sediment desorption study indicate that the modest increase of 0.7 pH units detected in the study site groundwater over the last 17 years since closure of the basins may be sufficient to produce the observed increased groundwater (129)I concentrations near the basins. Groundwater monitoring of the plume at the basins has shown that the migration of many of the high risk radionuclides originally present at this complex site has been attenuated. However, (129)I continues to leave the source at a rate that may have been exacerbated by the initial remediation efforts. This study underscores the importance of identifying the appropriate in situ stabilization technologies for all source contaminants, especially if their geochemical behaviors differ.},

abstract = {Many long-lived radionuclides are present in groundwater at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) as a result of 828 underground nuclear weapons tests conducted between 1951 and 1992. In conjunction with a comprehensive geochemical review of radionuclides (3H, 14C, 36Cl, 99Tc and 129I) that are presumably mobile in the subsurface, we synthesized a body of radionuclide activity data measured from groundwater samples collected at 18 monitoring wells, to qualitatively assess their migration at the NTS over distances of hundreds of meters and over timescales of decades. Tritium and 36Cl showed little evidence of retardation, while the transport of 14C may have been retarded by its isotopic exchange with carbonate minerals in the aquifer. Observed local reducing conditions (either natural or test-induced) will impact the mobility of certain redox-sensitive radionuclides (especially 99Tc) that were otherwise soluble and readily transported under oxidizing conditions. Conversely, strongly oxidizing conditions may impact the mobility of 129I which is mobile under reducing conditions. The effect of iodine speciation on its transport deserves further attention. Indication of delayed transport of some "mobile" radionuclides (especially 99Tc) in the groundwater at the NTS suggested the importance of redox conditions of the natural system in controlling the fate and transport of radionuclides, which has implications in the enhanced performance of the potential Yucca Mountain repository, located adjacent to the NTS, to store high-level nuclear wastes as well as management of radionuclide contamination in legacy nuclear operations facilities.},

abstract = {The groundwater contribution into Par Pond, a former cooling reservoir
for two nuclear reactors located on the Department of Energy's Savannah
River Site (South Carolina), was estimated using a standard hydrologic
budget as well as one augmented by a natural tracer approach. We
determined a geochemical budget for 222Rn, normally found at much
higher concentrations in groundwater than surface waters, to assist
in constraining the hydrologic estimates. The radon budget accounted
for all quantifiable surface sources and sinks including the flux
across the sediment-water interface which was determined by application
of an advection-diffusion model. All hydrologic parameters and radon
concentrations were monitored seasonally from February 1994 to August
1995. Using the water balance approach alone, the average groundwater
discharge entering the lake was estimated to have an upper limit
of approximately 0.95 � 0.13 m3 s-1. The groundwater contribution
obtained using the combined hydrologic/222Rn approach ranged from
0.17 to 0.76 m3 s-1 with a best estimate of 0.35 � 0.16 m3 s-1. Lake
profiles show enhanced 222Rn concentrations in some areas indicating
that groundwater enters Par Pond mostly through a small region in
the northern portion of the lake, probably via small seeps or springs.
Estimates show that groundwater plays a significant role in the overall
water budget of the lake, accounting for 10\%-33\% of the total estimated
inflow from all measured sources. Our results show that supplementing
a standard hydrological water balance with radon budget considerations
helps to constrain estimated groundwater flow into surface reservoirs.},

After closure and capping in 1991, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has being monitoring and remediating the groundwater plume. Despite numerous studies of the plume, its persistence for over 20 years has not been well understood. To better understand the plume dynamics, a limited number of deep boreholes were drilled to determine the current plume characteristics. A mixing model was developed to predict plume tritium and nitrate concentrations. We found that the plume trailing edges have emerged for some contaminants, and that contaminant recharge from the basin's vadose zone is still important. The model's estimated time-dependent basin drainage rates combined with dilution from natural recharge successfully predicted plume tritium and nitrate concentrations. This new understanding of source zone influences can help guide science-based remediation, and improve predictions of the natural attenuation timeframes.},

In the early years of the plant's operation, mea- surements of radioactivity did not cover all emission sources or all environmental media. For example, noble gas releases from the reactor area were not measured before 1971, and continuous monitoring of milk did not begin until 1962. A population dose assessment published in 1977 in an Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) report (1) was based on release estimates only. These obstacles would make a comprehensive environmental and health study a complex endeavor. Herein, environmental doses from external gamma radiation in the SRP vicinity are analyzed using the measurements taken by Du Pont. The results of this analysis are compared with data in the ERDA report and the inconsistencies are discussed.},

abstract = {Iodine is an important element in studies of environmental protection
and human health, global-scale hydrologic processes and nuclear nonproliferation.
Biogeochemical cycling of iodine is complex, because iodine occurs
in multiple oxidation states and as inorganic and organic species
that may be hydrophilic, atmophilic, and biophilic. In this study,
we applied new analytical techniques to study the sorption and transport
behavior of iodine species (iodide, iodate, and 4-iodoaniline) in
sediments collected at the Savannah River and Hanford Sites, where
anthropogenic 129I from prior nuclear fuel processing activities
poses an environmental risk. We conducted integrated column and batch
experiments to investigate the interconversion, sorption and transport
of iodine species, and the sediments we examined exhibit a wide range
in organic matter, clay mineralogy, soil pH, and texture. The results
of our experiments illustrate complex behavior with various processes
occurring, including iodate reduction, irreversible retention or
mass loss of iodide, and rate-limited and nonlinear sorption. There
was an appreciable iodate reduction to iodide, presumably mediated
by the structural Fe(II) in some clay minerals; therefore, careful
attention must be given to potential interconversion among species
when interpreting the biogeochemical behavior of iodine in the environment.
The different iodine species exhibited dramatically different sorption
and transport behavior in three sediment samples, possessing different
physico-chemical properties, collected from different depths at the
Savannah River Site. Our study yielded additional insight into processes
and mechanisms affecting the geochemical cycling of iodine in the
environment, and provided quantitative estimates of key parameters
(e.g., extent and rate of sorption) for risk assessment at these
sites.},

For radionuclides that adsorb onto suspended sediment, the omission of deposition/resuspension effects overestimates the downstream radionuclide peak concentration and is therefore conservative. For the case of cesium transport in the Fourmile Branch, the calculated reduction in peak concentration as the cesium is transported downstream is greater with sediment deposition modeled than without. For example, including the effects of sediment deposition/resuspension in the STREAM II calculation results in a 72\% reduction in the downstream (5075 meters downstream from H-Area) peak cesium concentration. It is important to note that the high partition coefficient appropriate for cesium enhances the importance of sediment deposition/resuspension; the reduction in the calculated peak concentration would be less for radioisotopes with lower partition coefficients.},

The experimental results indicated that in these soil media, the distribution coefficient of tritium is slightly influenced by adsorption time, water/solid ratio, initial tritium specific activity, pH, and the content of humic and fulvic acids. The average distribution coefficient from all of these influencing factors was about 0.1-0.2 mL/g for the four types of soil samples. This relatively modest sorption of tritium in soils needs to be considered in fate and transport studies of tritium in the environment.},

As iodine mobility varies greatly with iodine speciation, experiments with 129I-contaminated aquifer sediments from the Savannah River Site located in Aiken, SC, were carried out to test iodine interactions with soils and aquifer sediments. Using tracer 125I- and stable 127I- additions, it was shown that such interactions were highly dependent on I- concentrations added to sediment suspensions, contact time with the sediment, and organic carbon (OC) content, resulting in an empirical particle-water partition coefficient (Kd) that was an inverse power function of the added I- concentration. However, Kd values of organically bound 127I were 3 orders of magnitude higher than those determined after 1-2 weeks of tracer equilibration, approaching those of OC. Under ambient conditions, organo-iodine (OI) was a major fraction (67\%) of the total iodine in the dissolved phase and by implication of the particulate phase. As the total concentration of amended I- increased, the fraction of detectable dissolved OI decreased. This trend, attributed to OC becoming the limiting factor in the aquifer sediment explains why at elevated I-concentrations OI is often not detected.},

The primary focus of this program was to survey and track changes in tritium levels; however, specific conductivity, and pH were also surveyed and tracked. The measurements from the eleventh survey (May 1995) exhibited similar tritium levels, conductivity measurements, and pH values to data from previous sampling events. The overall results of the tritium survey and stream monitoring data (Looney et aL, 1993) indicate that the tritium plume resulting from the past operation of the seepage basins continues to flush from the Fourmile Branch wetland system.},

abstract = {This report is the first revision to a series of reports on radionuclides inn the SRS environment. Tritium was chosen as the first radionuclide in the series because the calculations used to assess the dose to the offsite population from SRS releases indicate that the dose due to tritium, through of small consequence, is one of the most important the radionuclides. This was recognized early in the site operation, and extensive measurements of tritium in the atmosphere, surface water, and ground water exist due to the effort of the Environmental Monitoring Section. In addition, research into the transport and fate of tritium in the environment has been supported at the SRS by both the local Department of Energy (DOE) Office and DOE's Office of Health and Environmental Research.},

abstract = {Tritium is released to the environment from many of the operations at the Savannah River Site. The releases from each facility to the atmosphere and to the soil and streams, both from normal operations and inadvertent releases, over the period of operation from the early 1950s through 1988 are presented. The fate of the tritium released is evaluated through environmental monitoring, special studies, and modeling. It is concluded that approximately 91\% of the tritium remaining after decay is now in the oceans. A dose and risk assessment to the population around the site is presented. It is concluded that about 0.6 fatal cancers may be associated with the tritium released during all the years of operation to the population of about 625,000. This same population (based on the overall US cancer statistics) is expected to experience about 105,000 cancer fatalities from all types of cancer. Therefore, it is considered unlikely that a relationship between any of the cancer deaths occurring in this population and releases of tritium from the SRS will be found.},

@article{Dong2012,
abstract = {The mobility of an acidic uranium waste plume in the F-Area of Savannah River Site is of great concern. In order to understand and predict uranium mobility, U(VI) adsorption experiments were performed as a function of pH using background F-Area aquifer sediments and reference goethite and kaolinite (major reactive phases of F-Area sediments), and a component-additivity (CA) based surface complexation model (SCM) was developed. Our experimental results indicate that the fine fractions (≤45 $\mu$m) in sediments control U(VI) adsorption due to their large surface area, although the quartz sands show a stronger adsorption ability per unit surface area than the fine fractions at pH < 5.0. Kaolinite is a more important sorbent for U(VI) at pH < 4.0, while goethite plays a major role at pH > 4.0. Our CA model combines an existing U(VI) SCM for goethite and a modified U(VI) SCM for kaolinite along with estimated relative surface area abundances of these component minerals. The modeling approach successfully predicts U(VI) adsorption behavior by the background F-Area sediments. The model suggests that exchange sites on kaolinite dominate U(VI) adsorption at pH < 4.0, goethite and kaolinite edge sites cocontribute to U(VI) adsorption at pH 4.0-6.0, and goethite dominates U(VI) adsorption at pH > 6.0.},

The book provides details of the construction and operation of nuclear reactors and associated facilities, as well as their decommissioning and the management of nuclear waste at the site. The contents detail the influence on the site of developments in nuclear science, the Cold War, environmental concerns, and domestic politics. The social and economic effects of the site on its region are also described. Numerous photographs, diagrams, and maps enrich the interesting narrative. The text includes descriptions of reactor technology and chemical separations developed at the site to improve the production of plutonium, heavy water, and tritium for the United States nuclear weapons program. The volume also includes a chronology, biographies of site managers, and an extensive set of endnotes. The book is published by the U.S. Department of Energy and therefore presents a single view of the Savannah River Site story.},

abstract = {Tracer tests were performed in distinct biogeochemical zones of a sand and gravel aquifer in Cape Cod, MA, to study the redox chemistry (I) and transport (Cs, I) of cesium and iodine in a field setting. Injection of iodide (I(-)) into an oxic zone of the aquifer resulted in oxidation of I(-) to molecular iodine (I(2)) and iodate (10(3)(-)) over transport distances of several meters. Oxidation is attributed to Mn-oxides present in the sediment Transport of injected 10(3)(-) and Cs(+) was retarded in the mildly acidic oxic zone, with retardation factors of 1.6-1.8 for 10(3)(-) and 2.3-4.4 for Cs. Cs retardation was likely due to cation exchange reactions. Injection of 10(3)(-) into a Fe-reducing zone of the aquifer resulted in rapid and complete reduction to I(-) within 3 m of transport. Then on conservative behavior of Cs and I observed during the tracer tests underscores the necessity of taking the redox chemistry of I as well as sorption properties of I species and Cs into account when predicting transport of radionuclides (e.g., (129)I and (137)Cs) in the environment.},
