@article{Corbett1997,
abstract = {The groundwater contribution into Par Pond, a former cooling reservoir
for two nuclear reactors located on the Department of Energy's Savannah
River Site (South Carolina), was estimated using a standard hydrologic
budget as well as one augmented by a natural tracer approach. We
determined a geochemical budget for 222Rn, normally found at much
higher concentrations in groundwater than surface waters, to assist
in constraining the hydrologic estimates. The radon budget accounted
for all quantifiable surface sources and sinks including the flux
across the sediment-water interface which was determined by application
of an advection-diffusion model. All hydrologic parameters and radon
concentrations were monitored seasonally from February 1994 to August
1995. Using the water balance approach alone, the average groundwater
discharge entering the lake was estimated to have an upper limit
of approximately 0.95 � 0.13 m3 s-1. The groundwater contribution
obtained using the combined hydrologic/222Rn approach ranged from
0.17 to 0.76 m3 s-1 with a best estimate of 0.35 � 0.16 m3 s-1. Lake
profiles show enhanced 222Rn concentrations in some areas indicating
that groundwater enters Par Pond mostly through a small region in
the northern portion of the lake, probably via small seeps or springs.
Estimates show that groundwater plays a significant role in the overall
water budget of the lake, accounting for 10\%-33\% of the total estimated
inflow from all measured sources. Our results show that supplementing
a standard hydrological water balance with radon budget considerations
helps to constrain estimated groundwater flow into surface reservoirs.},

@article{Wan2012a,
abstract = {At the Savannah River Site's F-Area, wastewaters containing radionuclides were disposed into seepage basins for decades. After closure and capping in 1991, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has being monitoring and remediating the groundwater plume. Despite numerous studies of the plume, its persistence for over 20 years has not been well understood. To better understand the plume dynamics, a limited number of deep boreholes were drilled to determine the current plume characteristics. A mixing model was developed to predict plume tritium and nitrate concentrations. We found that the plume trailing edges have emerged for some contaminants, and that contaminant recharge from the basin's vadose zone is still important. The model's estimated time-dependent basin drainage rates combined with dilution from natural recharge successfully predicted plume tritium and nitrate concentrations. This new understanding of source zone influences can help guide science-based remediation, and improve predictions of the natural attenuation timeframes.},

@article{Beals1995,
abstract = {Surface water samples were collected from streams on and around the
Savannah River Site (SRS) to assess current3H, 99Tc, and 129I concentrations
in the water. The SRS is a nuclear facility operated by Westinghouse
Savannah River Company for the US Department of Energy. Water quality
parameters were measured at the time of collection using field portable
instrumentation. The tritium activity was determined by liquid scintillation
spectrometry. The isotopes, 99Tc and 129I, were determined by isotope
dilution/inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (D.M. Beals,

International Conference on Nuclear and Radiochemistry, Vienna, September
1992, unpublished data; D.M. Beals, P. Chastagner and P.K. Turner,

on Bioassay, Analytical and Environmental Radiochemistry, Santa Fe,
NM, November 1992). Elevated activities of 3H, 99Tc, and 129I were
found in some surface streams of the SRS, principally due to migration
of ground water from beneath old seepage basins, however the levels
in the waters leaving the SRS are well below any regulatory guidelines.},

@article{Dong2012,
abstract = {The mobility of an acidic uranium waste plume in the F-Area of Savannah River Site is of great concern. In order to understand and predict uranium mobility, U(VI) adsorption experiments were performed as a function of pH using background F-Area aquifer sediments and reference goethite and kaolinite (major reactive phases of F-Area sediments), and a component-additivity (CA) based surface complexation model (SCM) was developed. Our experimental results indicate that the fine fractions (≤45 $\mu$m) in sediments control U(VI) adsorption due to their large surface area, although the quartz sands show a stronger adsorption ability per unit surface area than the fine fractions at pH < 5.0. Kaolinite is a more important sorbent for U(VI) at pH < 4.0, while goethite plays a major role at pH > 4.0. Our CA model combines an existing U(VI) SCM for goethite and a modified U(VI) SCM for kaolinite along with estimated relative surface area abundances of these component minerals. The modeling approach successfully predicts U(VI) adsorption behavior by the background F-Area sediments. The model suggests that exchange sites on kaolinite dominate U(VI) adsorption at pH < 4.0, goethite and kaolinite edge sites cocontribute to U(VI) adsorption at pH 4.0-6.0, and goethite dominates U(VI) adsorption at pH > 6.0.},
