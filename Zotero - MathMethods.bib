@article{Howarth1979,
abstract = {In the context of analysis of variance, Box and Cox (1964) developed a generalized technique for power transformation of frequency distributions to normality. It is here applied to geochemical data, based on the nonlinear optimization of skewness and kurtosis. The transform appears to be particularly well suited to the preprocessing of geochemical data prior to multivariate analysis.},

@book{Chakraverty2014,
abstract = {For various scientific and engineering problems, how to deal with variables and parameters of uncertain value is an important issue. Full analysis of the specific errors in measurement, observations, experiments, and applications are vital in dealing with the parameters taken to simplify the problem. Mathematics of Uncertainty Modeling in the Analysis of Engineering and Science Problems aims to provide the reader with basic concepts for soft computing and other methods for various means of uncertainty in handling solutions, analysis, and applications. This book is an essential reference work for students, scholars, practitioners and researchers in the assorted fields of engineering and applied mathematics interested in a model for uncertain physical problems.},

@article{Mishali2007,
abstract = {We address the problem of reconstructing a multi-band signal from its sub-Nyquist point-wise samples. To date, all reconstruction methods proposed for this class of signals assumed knowledge of the band locations. In this paper, we develop a non-linear blind perfect reconstruction scheme for multi-band signals which does not require the band locations. Our approach assumes an existing blind multi-coset sampling method. The sparse structure of multi-band signals in the continuous frequency domain is used to replace the continuous reconstruction with a single finite dimensional problem without the need for discretization. The resulting problem can be formulated within the framework of compressed sensing, and thus can be solved efficiently using known tractable algorithms from this emerging area. We also develop a theoretical lower bound on the average sampling rate required for blind signal reconstruction, which is twice the minimal rate of known-spectrum recovery. Our method ensures perfect reconstruction for a wide class of signals sampled at the minimal rate. Numerical experiments are presented demonstrating blind sampling and reconstruction with minimal sampling rate.},

@article{Gluzman2006,
abstract = {A method is suggested allowing for the improvement of accuracy of self-similar factor and root approximants, constructed from asymptotic series. The method is based on performing a power transforms of the given asymptotic series, with the power of this transformation being a control function. The latter is defined by a fixed-point condition, which improves the convergence of the sequence of the resulting approximants. The method makes it possible to extrapolate the behaviour of a function, given as an expansion over a small variable, to the region of the large values of this variable. Several examples illustrate the effectiveness of the method},

abstract = {K.F. Cheung and R.J. Marks (ibid., vol.CAS-32, no.5 p.481-4, 1985) have shown that if at least one of the interpolation functions used in the generalized sampling expansion of A. Papoulis (1977) is not square-integrable, then the problem is ill-posed in the sense that the variance of the reconstruction error is unbounded when noisy samples are used. It is shown that if all the interpolation functions are square-integrable, then the generalized sampling problem is well posed, essentially a converse of the Cheung-Marks result. A useful alternative sufficient condition for well-posedness that depends only on the transfer characteristics of the channels and does not require explicit calculation of the interpolation functions is developed. Several examples illustrating the results are given; in particular, the important nonuniform sampling strategy of J.L. Yen (IRE Trans. Circuits Theory, vol.
