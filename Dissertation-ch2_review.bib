@article{Carrera1993,
abstract = {Model predictions are uncertain because of uncertainties on future and/or anthropogenic stresses, parameter values and conceptual models. The first two groups of problems can be addressed through rather systematic methods (scenario analysis, error transmission techniques, automatic calibration algorithms, etc.). However, conceptual uncertainties are rarely given adequate attention. The objective of this paper is to synthesize conceptual difficulties associated with transport. These include: (1) processes that are significant at small scales may not be relevant at large scales; (2) inversely, new processes (e.g., dispersion) emerge in response to increase in scale and the way to represent them may depend on the assumed model structure; (3) the observed shapes of both breakthrough curves and pollutant plumes are not well represented by the classical transport equation; (4) porosities and dispersivities derived from field tracer tests often exhibit a directional dependence; etc. Though not directly related to solute transport, scale effects on hydraulic conductivity may also affect solute transport modelling. When these anomalies are examined, it is concluded that they are directly or indirectly caused by heterogeneity. Current approaches for dealing with heterogeneity can be divided into stochastic and deterministic. Stochastic methods have been successful in explaining qualitatively some anomalies of solute transport, but they appear to be far from reaching a stage at which they can be used routinely for solving realistic field problems. On the other hand, when applied with care, deterministic methods have been successfully used in actual problems. Yet, it can be argued that they fail to account for small-scale variability of concentrations so that they would become ineffective when dealing with nonlinear processes, such as chemical reactions. Relevance of on-going research for overcoming these difficulties is discussed.},

abstract = {Difficulties in defining truly mechanistic model structures and difficulties of model calibration and validation suggest that the application of distributed hydrological models is more an exercise in prophecy than prediction. One response to these problems is outlined in terms of a realistic assessment of uncertainty in hydrological prophecy, together with a framework (GLUE) within which such ideas can be implemented. It is suggested that a post-modernistic hydrology will recognise the uncertainties inherent in hydrological modelling and will focus attention on the value of data in conditioning hydrological prophecies.},

@article{Bloschl1995,
abstract = {A framework is provided for scaling and scale issues in hydrology. The first section gives some basic definitions. This is important as researchers do not seem to have agreed on the meaning of concepts such as scale or upscaling. ‘Process scale’, ‘observation scale’ and ‘modelling (working) scale’ require different definitions. The second section discusses heterogeneity and variability in catchments and touches on the implications of randomness and organization for scaling. The third section addresses the linkages across scales from a modelling point of view. It is argued that up- scaling typically consists of two steps: distributing and aggregating. Conversely, downscaling involves disaggregation and singling out. Different approaches are discussed for linking state variables, parameters, inputs and conceptual- izations across scales. This section also deals with distributed parameter models, which are one way of linking con- ceptualizations across scales. The fourth section addresses the linkages across scales from a more holistic perspective dealing with dimensional analysis and similarity concepts. The main difference to the modelling point of view is that dimensional analysis and similarity concepts deal with complex processes in a much simpler fashion. Examples of dimensional analysis, similarity analysis and functional normalization in catchment hydrology are given. This section also briefly discusses fractals, which are a popular tool for quantifying variability across scales. The fifth section focuses on one particular aspect of this holistic view, discussing stream network analysis. The paper concludes with identifying key issues and gives some directions for future research.},

@article{Beven1989,
abstract = {This paper argues that there are fundamental problems in the application of physically-based models for practical prediction in hydrology. These problems result from limitations of the model equations relative to a heterogeneous reality; the lack of a theory of subgrid scale integration; practical constraints on solution methodologies; and problems of dimensionality in parameter calibration. It is suggested that most current applications of physically-based models use them as lumped conceptual models at the grid scale. Recent papers on physically-based models have misunderstood and misrepresented these limitations. There are practical hydrological problems requiring physically-based predictions, and there will continue to be a need for physically-based models but ideas about their capabilities must change so that future applications attempt to obtain realistic estimates of the uncertainty associated with their predictions, particularly in the case of evaluating future scenarios of the effects of management strategies.},

@article{Beven2001,
abstract = {It may be endemic to mechanistic modelling of complex environmental systems that there are many different model structures and many different parameter sets within a chosen model structure that may be behavioural or acceptable in reproducing the observed behaviour of that system. This has been called the equifinality concept. The generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodology for model identification allowing for equifinality is described. Prediction within this methodology is a process of ensemble forecasting using a sample of parameter sets from the behavioural model space, with each sample weighted according to its likelihood measure to estimate prediction quantiles. This allows that different models may contribute to the ensemble prediction interval at different time steps and that the distributional form of the predictions may change over time. Any effects of model nonlinearity, covariation of parameter values and errors in model structure, input data or observed variables, with which the simulations are compared, are handled implicitly within this procedure. GLUE involves a number of choices that must be made explicit and can be therefore subjected to scrutiny and discussion. These include ways of combining information from different types of model evaluation or from different periods in a data assimilation context. An example application to rainfall-runoff modelling is used to illustrate the methodology, including the updating of likelihood measures.},

Here, we also focus on how these proposed suites of instrumentation can be used to address key scientific challenges, including scaling water cycle science in time and space, broadening the scope of individual subdisciplines of water cycle science, and developing mechanistic linkages among these subdisciplines and spatio-temporal scales.},

@article{Kirchner2000,
abstract = {The time it takes for rainfall to travel through a catchment and reach the stream is a fundamental hydraulic parameter that controls the retention of soluble contaminants and thus the downstream consequences of pollution episodes. Catchments with short flushing times will deliver brief, intense contaminant pulses to downstream waters, whereas catchments with longer flushing times will deliver less intense but more sustained contaminant fluxes. Here we analyse detailed time series of chloride, a natural tracer, in both rainfall and runoff from headwater catchments at Plynlimon, Wales. We show that, although the chloride concentrations in rainfall have a white noise spectrum, the chloride concentrations in streamflow exhibit fractal 1/f scaling over three orders of magnitude. The fractal fluctuations in tracer concentrations indicate that these catchments do not have characteristic flushing times. Instead, their travel times follow an approximate power-law distribution implying that they will retain a long chemical memory of past inputs. Contaminants will initially be flushed rapidly, but then low-level contamination will be delivered to streams for a surprisingly long time.},
