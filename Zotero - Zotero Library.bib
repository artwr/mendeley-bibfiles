abstract = {Contamination of groundwater constrains its uses and poses a serious threat to the environment. Once groundwater is contaminated, the cleanup may be difficult and expensive. Identification of unknown pollution sources is the first step toward adopting any remediation strategy. The proposed methodology exploits the capability of a universal function approximation by a feed-forward multilayer artificial neural network (ANN) to identify the sources in terms of its location, magnitudes, and duration of activity. The back-propagation algorithm is utilized for training the ANN to identify the source characteristics based on simulated concentration data at specified observation locations in the aquifer. Uniform random generation and the Latin hypercube sampling method of random generation are used to generate temporal varying source fluxes. These source fluxes are used in groundwater flow and the transport simulation model to generate necessary data for the ANN model-building processes. Breakthrough curves obtained for the specified pollution scenario are characterized by different methods. The characterized breakthrough curves parameters serve as inputs to ANN model. Unknown pollution source characteristics are outputs for ANN model. Experimentation is also performed with different number of training and testing patterns. In addition, the effects of measurement errors in concentration measurements values are used to show the robustness of ANN based methodology for source identification in case of erroneous data.},

abstract = {Air pollution is the presence of contaminants or substances in the air that interfere with human health or welfare, or produce other harmful environmental effects. This chapter focuses on the waste streams that affect the atmosphere. The predominant concern with atmospheric waste is chemical contamination, which presents a hazard to human health. Thus, public health is usually the principal driver for assessing and controlling air contaminants. However, air pollution abatement laws and programs have also recognized that effects beyond health are also important, especially welfare protection. One of the main welfare considerations is that ecosystems are important receptors of contamination. Another welfare concern is that contaminants impact structures and other engineered systems by corrosion. Thus, from an air pollution perspective, there is a cascade of hazards from human health to ecosystems to abiotic (i.e., nonliving) systems. As far as pollution control is concerned, air pollution control must be strategic and tactical. The former is the long-term reduction of pollution levels at all scales of the problem from local to global. Goals can be set for air quality improvement 5, 10, or 15 years ahead and plans can be made to achieve these improvements.},

abstract = {Historically, waste management has been inextricably linked with the evolution of human communities, population growth, and the emergence and development of commerce. During the past century, consumption and production patterns have changed radically—due in part to the greater freedom of movement of money, goods, and people. A horizontal framework has been established for waste management, including definitions and principles. Treatment operations were defined vertically—to include the control of landfill and incineration. A body of standards is currently being prepared for treatment operations—through the International Standards Organization, with support from national standards bodies. Reuse and recycling are being integrated into industrial activities. However, as they are interpreted today, the concepts of reuse and recycling are inextricably linked to the production and management of waste and by extension, to its prevention and minimization. Reuse and recycling have evolved into two of the four pillars that support improved resource management through the prevention of waste and the reuse, recycling, and recovery of the wastes that do occur to achieve sustainable developmental goals by reducing reliance on natural resources.},

Determining damages for past contamination of groundwater by surface discharges of hazardous substances requires knowledge of developments in groundwater hydrology. A review of the scientific literature on the motion of subsurface fluids, public health, and sanitary engineering indicates that by 1940 knowledge was sufficient to argue against surface discharges of harmful fluids. Legal precedent, though inconsistent, proved there was ample awareness of the physical processes and financial liabilities before 1950 to expect careful disposal of liquid wastes to a land surface.},

abstract = {This Chapter explores military waste issues. It focuses on the issues associated with the United States Army from existing military facilities and from base camp operations. The Army has facilities to house and train troops, store munitions, support operational commands, conduct research and development, and engage in the production of munitions. Of course, many facilities combine several aspects of these activities. Within these facilities, a wide range of activities can take place, each of which may result in the generation of various waste streams. These include typical household wastes from housing areas, office wastes from various administrative and command activities, landscaping wastes, and construction and demolition (C\&D) wastes. Therefore, in many ways, wastes generated at military facilities are similar to civilian residential communities and commercial facilities. However, training areas in particular provide substantially different waste issues than commonly found in civilian environments. Another area of substantial difference is the management of explosive munitions, particularly the decommissioning of out-of-specification materials.},

@article{Ye2010,
abstract = {This study evaluates alternative groundwater models with different recharge and geologic components at the northern Yucca Flat area of the Death Valley Regional Flow System (DVRFS), USA. Recharge over the DVRFS has been estimated using five methods, and five geological interpretations are available at the northern Yucca Flat area. Combining the recharge and geological components together with additional modeling components that represent other hydrogeological conditions yields a total of 25 groundwater flow models. As all the models are plausible given available data and information, evaluating model uncertainty becomes inevitable. On the other hand, hydraulic parameters (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) are uncertain in each model, giving rise to parametric uncertainty. Propagation of the uncertainty in the models and model parameters through groundwater modeling causes predictive uncertainty in model predictions (e.g., hydraulic head and flow). Parametric uncertainty within each model is assessed using Monte Carlo simulation, and model uncertainty is evaluated using the model averaging method. Two model-averaging techniques (on the basis of information criteria and GLUE) are discussed. This study shows that contribution of model uncertainty to predictive uncertainty is significantly larger than that of parametric uncertainty. For the recharge and geological components, uncertainty in the geological interpretations has more significant effect on model predictions than uncertainty in the recharge estimates. In addition, weighted residuals vary more for the different geological models than for different recharge models. Most of the calibrated observations are not important for discriminating between the alternative models, because their weighted residuals vary only slightly from one model to another.},

abstract = {What is model selection? What are the goals of model selection? What are the methods of model selection and how do they work? Which methods perform better than others and in what circumstances? These questions rest on a number of key concepts in a relatively underdeveloped field. The aim of this paper is to explain some background concepts, to highlight some of the results in this special issue, and to add my own. The standard methods of model selection include classical hypothesis testing, maximum likelihood, Bayes method, minimum description length, cross-validation, and Akaike's information criterion. They all provide an implementation of Occam's razor, in which parsimony or simplicity is balanced against goodness-of-fit. These methods primarily take account of the sampling errors in parameter estimation, although their relative success at this task depends on the circumstances. However, the aim of model selection should also include the ability of a model to generalize to predictions in a different domain. Errors of extrapolation, or generalization, are different from errors of parameter estimation. So, it seems that simplicity and parsimony may be an additional factor in managing these errors, in which case the standard methods of model selection are incomplete implementations of Occam's razor.

Wealthy communities form throw away societies, whereas poor communities have less to throw away and are more ingenious in reusing, recycling and refurbishing articles that a wealthier community would discard. The simple but inadequate waste dumps of yesterday are still among people in most of the developing world, whereas the developed world is using the vastly improved sanitary landfill of today while planning and experimenting with and tentatively applying the still more improved landfill technology of tomorrow. The generation rate of municipal solid waste (MSW) is an important consideration in the selection of a suitably large disposal site and in the design of landfills, whether the economy is developed, developing or mixed. The sanitary landfill and the MSW of the future should have much reduced organic contents, and landfills should therefore generate less landfill gas (LFG) and (possibly) a less polluting leachate. Unfortunately, some residues will always remain, (e.g. the ash from RDF fuelled power stations) and hence the landfill will probably always remain. It is a challenge to the citizens to make the landfills of tomorrow much better, safer and less polluting than those of today.},

@article{Bozdogan2000a,
abstract = {In this paper we briefly study the basic idea of Akaike's (1973) information criterion (AIC). Then, we present some recent developments on a new entropic or information complexity (ICOMP) criterion of Bozdogan (1988a, 1988b, 1990, 1994d, 1996, 1998a, 1998b) for model selection. A rationale for ICOMP as a model selection criterion is that it combines a badness-of-fit term (such as minus twice the maximum log likelihood) with a measure of complexity of a model differently than AIC, or its variants, by taking into account the interdependencies of the parameter estimates as well as the dependencies of the model residuals. We operationalize the general form of ICOMP based on the quantification of the concept of overall model complexity in terms of the estimated inverse-Fisher information matrix. This approach results in an approximation to the sum of two Kullback-Leibler distances. Using the correlational form of the complexity, we further provide yet another form of ICOMP to take into account the interdependencies (i.e., correlations) among the parameter estimates of the model. Later, we illustrate the practical utility and the importance of this new model selection criterion by providing several real as well as Monte Carlo simulation examples and compare its performance against AIC, or its variants.

abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of regulations and issues relating to the generation, storage, treatment, and disposal of regulated medical waste (RMW), generally referred to as healthcare waste (HCW) in the United States, the United Kingdom, in Europe, and elsewhere. It illustrates a comprehensive definition of what is generally considered to be RMW/HCW, to provide a brief history of the catalysts that prompted an international regulatory response to the potential hazards associated with this waste stream, and to discuss the development of regulations and rules relating to RMW/HCW. Currently established frameworks and standards relating to the characterization, packaging, treatment, and disposal of RMW/HCW from an international perspective demonstrate a range of disparities according to the cited literature, and they are generally dependent on several factors—existing socioeconomic issues and government provisions, the level and quality of education and resources provided to the public, the provision and use of appropriate treatment technologies for viable and effective disposition of this waste stream, and regulatory initiatives and enforcement provisions available to curtail the inappropriate handling, treatment, and disposal of items within this waste stream. Many industrialized nations have developed regulations that adequately and effectively provide safe and environmentally viable means for the treatment and disposal of RMW/HCW, but financial and regulatory burdens remain significant obstacles for nations lacking necessary resources.},

abstract = {Tyres are an essential part of the economy of every country that relies on vehicular and air transport to move people and goods. The management of post-consumer tyres is greatly influenced by environmental legislation at International, European Union (EU), and State levels. Each has had an important impact on recycling—and recyclers—from sourcing raw materials, to product development and marketing, and the disposal of recycling residues. The starting point for tyre recycling is the same as other industries—the sourcing of a continuous flow of raw materials. Historically, post-consumer tyres have been collected separately and sorted into two sectors—the part worn market (second-hand) and retreading. However, as retreading dwindled, reuse/export stagnated, material recycling and energy recovery operations began to absorb the tyres. In many countries with large retreading industries, the infrastructure for collecting, sorting and transporting tyres became the means of servicing. Generally, prior to delivery to a treatment facility, the tyres are sorted by category, including car, truck and others, and then by size. Tyre recycling treatments range from the simplest mechanical cutting devices to sophisticated, complex multi-phase chemical, mechanochemical and thermal processes, which overcome many of the principal obstacles inherent in the recycling of thermoset rubbers.},

abstract = {The present study demonstrates a methodology for optimization of environmental data acquisition. Based on the premise that the worth of data increases in proportion to its ability to reduce the uncertainty of key model predictions, the methodology can be used to compare the worth of different data types, gathered at different locations within study areas of arbitrary complexity. The method is applied to a hypothetical nonlinear, variable density numerical model of salt and heat transport. The relative utilities of temperature and concentration measurements at different locations within the model domain are assessed in terms of their ability to reduce the uncertainty associated with predictions of movement of the salt water interface in response to a decrease in fresh water recharge. In order to test the sensitivity of the method to nonlinear model behavior, analyses were repeated for multiple realizations of system properties. Rankings of observation worth were similar for all realizations, indicating robust performance of the methodology when employed in conjunction with a highly nonlinear model. The analysis showed that while concentration and temperature measurements can both aid in the prediction of interface movement, concentration measurements, especially when taken in proximity to the interface at locations where the interface is expected to move, are of greater worth than temperature measurements. Nevertheless, it was also demonstrated that pairs of temperature measurements, taken in strategic locations with respect to the interface, can also lead to more precise predictions of interface movement.},

abstract = {Mine wastes and their environmentally acceptable storage constitute the largest waste problem on the planet. Mine wastes have been accumulating for thousands of years, and their rate of production has accelerated in step with increases of the human population to an estimated world-wide production rate of 350 × 109ta-1. If collected and spread in a uniform thickness, the waste could cover the 84 000 km2 area of Ireland to a depth of more than 2 metres.
The types and characteristics of mine wastes and the ways in which they are stored are described. Mine waste storages are dangerous structures in terms of associated accidental deaths and continuing environmental hazards. Situations leading to failure, types of failures and methods of preventing their occurrence and minimizing environmental damage are described with illustrative examples.
Mining activities produce larger quantities of waste and have more adverse environmental impacts than waste from any other human activity. This chapter outlines the subject of mine waste storage. Mine waste can be divided into coarse grained wastes that are usually stored in surface dumps, and fine-grained wastes, usually stored in hydraulic-fill structures. Both coarse and fine mine wastes could contain toxic substances, emit radioactive radon gas, or be combustible. Therefore, mine waste storages need to be constructed and protected in such a way that their adverse effects on human health and the natural environment are minimized on a long-term, continuing basis. Fortunately, controls and statutory regulations for the storage of mine waste are being tightened in most countries, and at the same time, the engineering skills needed to construct and maintain storages safely and for long periods of time are also improving. It is very important to realize that once amine waste storage has been created, it constitutes a hazard that requires ongoing maintenance and care for millennia to come.},

abstract = {There are two broad areas of pollution that pose ongoing negative impacts to the public. These are legacy pollution and ongoing releases. Legacy pollution refers to toxic chemical releases into the environment during a time pre-dating strict environmental enforcement practices. “Standard of Care” is a term of art that is generally defined as the degree of prudence and caution required of an individual who is under a duty of care. Generally, it is thought to concern the degree of caution that a reasonable person should exercise in a given situation so as to avoid causing injury. It is the watchfulness, attention, caution, and prudence that a reasonable person under the same or similar circumstances would exercise. Strict environmental enforcement has made the single most difference in overall improved environmental performance by industry. The fear of fines, penalties, and even imprisonment of owners and operators who violate statutory obligations under pollution control permits have driven industry on the whole to adopt BMPs and to make investments into controls. Finally, good corporate governance includes environmental stewardship as a foundation. From the most general standpoint, Responsible Care means acting in a responsible manner toward public and worker safety, protecting the environment, and respecting the properties and quality of life of others.},

In this study, batch tests were carried out using four soils from China: silty clays from An County and Jiangyou County in Sichuan Province, both of which could be considered candidate sites for Very Low Level Waste disposal; silty sand from Beijing; and loess from Yuci County in Shanxi Province, a typical Chinese loess region. The experimental results indicated that in these soil media, the distribution coefficient of tritium is slightly influenced by adsorption time, water/solid ratio, initial tritium specific activity, pH, and the content of humic and fulvic acids. The average distribution coefficient from all of these influencing factors was about 0.1-0.2 mL/g for the four types of soil samples. This relatively modest sorption of tritium in soils needs to be considered in fate and transport studies of tritium in the environment.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to formalize the generalization criterion method for model comparison. The method has the potential to provide powerful comparisons of complex and nonnested models that may also differ in terms of numbers of parameters. The generalization criterion differs from the better known cross-validation criterion in the following critical procedure. Although both employ a calibration stage to estimate parameters, cross-validation employs a replication sample from the same design for the validation stage, whereas generalization employs a new design for the critical stage. Two examples of the generalization criterion method are presented that demonstrate its usefulness for selecting a model based on sound scientific principles out of a set that also contains models lacking sound scientific principles that are either overly complex or oversimplified. The main advantage of the generalization criterion is its reliance on extrapolations to new conditions. After all, accurate a priori predictions to new conditions are the hallmark of a good scientific theory. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {In today's global economy, the practice of sustainable development is of particular importance to the handling of toxic materials such as lead to encourage industrial organizations and its stakeholders to take an active role in maximizing human and environmental health. Currently, there is limited information on recycling rates for lead-acid batteries (LAB) in the published literature. By the late 1900s, the use of lead was significantly reduced or eliminated in non-battery products in most of the developed and developing countries, including gasoline, paints, solders, and water systems. As the use of lead in non-lead battery products has continued to decline, the demand of lead has continued to grow in starting–lighting–ignition (SLI) and non-SLI LAB applications (such as, motive sources of power for industrial forklifts, mining equipment, airport ground equipment, uninterruptible power systems in telecommunication networks). In the early 2000s, the total demand for lead in all types of lead-acid storage batteries represented around 88\% of apparent lead consumption. Three opportunities for lead recovery and recycling include lead in spent batteries with consumers, mishandled batteries sent to auto wreckers, and lead in spent batteries in municipal waste. In light of increased lead prices, it makes economic and environmental sense to maximize lead recovery and recycling by establishing a strong ecologic interface between various stakeholders and consumers.},

abstract = {The built environment consumes more natural resources than necessary and therefore generates a large amount of waste. This chapter sheds light on the idea of rethinking construction waste management by reengineering processes and practices to reduce construction waste at source. It examines the concept of waste and definitions. Rethinking waste management in construction requires adopting ‘cyclic’ rather than ‘linear’ approach to design and construction. This requires re-engineering current practice to contribute to a cleaner environment through efficient and cost effective sustainable waste minimization strategies. Following this, the chapter discusses construction waste quantification and source evaluation. It also explores current thinking on construction waste research and appraises the current construction waste management and minimization status in the United Kingdom (UK) in terms of drivers and pressures for change, design and onsite practices, and challenges and enablers. For waste minimization to be effective and self-sustaining, it is important that all stakeholders along the construction supply chain embrace a more proactive approach in dealing with waste. In recognition of the responsibility of the architectural profession, through its leading role in project management and a key player in the construction industry, architects should move beyond the concept of eco-efficiency through bolt-on environmental strategies and strive to adopt eco-effective practices by implementing a holistic approach to design out waste, which will be reinforced in tender documents and implemented during the construction stage, in addition to the capture and dissemination of lessons learnt to inform construction waste reduction baselines and benchmarking in future projects.},

abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of the large number of waste regulations, with a particular emphasis on the regulatory environment in the United States and the United Kingdom. Environmental laws and rules address all types of wastes that find their way to the land, air and water. The regulations not only address waste streams, but the safety of products.
Environmental problems faced today differ from those of most of the Earth's history in both kind and degree. Society and its elected and appointed delegates increasingly respond to waste-related problems by writing and enforcing laws. The number of laws enacted to address various aspects of wastes has grown substantially in recent decades. Waste management requires attention to the waste and the characteristics of the place where the waste is found. This place is known as the “environmental medium.” The major environmental media are air, water, soil, sediment, and even biota. To make the regulation of wastes is even more refined, waste management must be viewed systematically. Wastes tend to be transported and can cause problems well beyond the borders of nations. One of the key waste management challenges of the twenty-first century is the ease at which waste problems are simply transferred to countries with less stringent controls. The interconnections of wastes can lead to a “circle of poisons,” the phenomenon where nations may ban a substance, but it continues to be produced and used in other, usually less economically developed, countries. Despite the ban within the borders of certain countries, the feared substance returns. Thus, the rationale for the ban, that is reduced risks to that country's inhabitants, is forgone and people continue to be exposed when they import the products that contain or are contaminated with the banned substances.},

abstract = {Since the advent of the modern nuclear age in the 1940’s, man has effectively managed the often hazardous waste produced by nuclear processes. Expansion of nuclear energy worldwide is likely to meet increased power demands and greenhouse gas reduction targets and will result in increased radioactive waste generation. Managing this waste effectively is a critical component of a world-wide “nuclear renaissance.” Past practice has proven the wastes generated from nuclear power generation can be effectively managed using technologies that are well demonstrated at industrial scales, with decades of safe operating practices. Emphasis is necessary to ensure that future nuclear fuel cycles remain economically and environmentally competitive (as compared to other forms of energy production) and do not produce legacy waste management issues for future generations. This chapter discusses the history of nuclear waste management and provides the current “state-of-the-art” for management of all forms of nuclear waste.
Expansion of nuclear energy worldwide is necessary to meet increased power demands and greenhouse gas reduction targets. Virtually any international energy forecast predicts large growth in nuclear power generation over the next 30–50 years. The expansion of commercial nuclear power production is likely to result in increased radioactive waste generation. Managing this waste effectively is a critical component of a worldwide nuclear renaissance and is a primary consideration for future nuclear fuel cycles. Wastes generated from nuclear power generation can be effectively managed using technologies that are well demonstrated at industrial scales, with decades of safe operating practices. As the worldwide community continues to investigate advanced nuclear fuel cycles, radioactive waste management considerations are being given increased emphasis and are, in fact, being considered at the advent of proposed fuel cycles. This emphasis is necessary to ensure that future nuclear fuel cycles remain economically and environmentally competitive (as compared with other forms of energy production) and do not produce legacy waste management issues for future generations.},

abstract = {This chapter addresses the benefits and drawbacks of various thermal destruction and removal technologies. Chemical reactions at elevated temperatures can yield products that are either good or bad from an environmental perspective. This chapter focuses on the thermal reactions that can be used to treat numerous wastes. Complete combustion may also result in the production of molecular nitrogen (N2) when nitrogen-containing organics are burned, such as in the combustion of methylamine. Incomplete combustion can produce a variety of compounds. Some are more toxic than the original compounds being oxidized, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxins, furans, and CO. The organic portion of wastes has heat value. This means that this portion of any waste can be completely destroyed using principles based on thermodynamics, ultimately yielding carbon dioxide and water. This depends mainly on whether toxic and otherwise harmful molecules react to become less or more toxic or harmful molecules, or are transformed into molecules that are more or less mobile in the environment, which could mean greater exposures and risks. Recalcitrant waste constituents can be degraded using these techniques but caution should always be applied as improper applications of thermal technologies can lead to harm caused by products of incomplete combustion (PICs) and other pollutants.},

@article{Oreskes1998,
abstract = {The present regulatory climate has led to increasing demands for scientists to attest to the predictive reliability of numerical simulation models used to help set public policy, a process frequently referred to as model validation. But while model validation may reveal useful information, this paper argues that it is not possible to demonstrate the predictive reliability of any model of a complex natural system in advance of its actual use. All models embed uncertainties, and these uncertainties can and frequently do undermine predictive reliability. In the case of lead in the environment, we may categorize model uncertainties as theoretical, empirical, parametrical, and temporal. Theoretical uncertainties are aspects of the system that are not fully understood, such as the biokinetic pathways of lead metabolism. Empirical uncertainties are aspects of the system that are difficult (or impossible) to measure, such as actual lead ingestion by an individual child. Parametrical uncertainties arise when complexities in the system are simplified to provide manageable model input, such as representing longitudinal lead exposure by cross-sectional measurements. Temporal uncertainties arise from the assumption that systems are stable in time. A model may also be conceptually flawed. The Ptolemaic system of astronomy is a historical example of a model that was empirically adequate but based on a wrong conceptualization. Yet had it been computerized--and had the word then existed--its users would have had every right to call it validated. Thus, rather than talking about strategies for validation, we should be talking about means of evaluation. That is not to say that language alone will solve our problems or that the problems of model evaluation are primarily linguistic. The uncertainties inherent in large, complex models will not go away simply because we change the way we talk about them. But this is precisely the point: calling a model validated does not make it valid. Modelers and policymakers must continue to work toward finding effective ways to evaluate and judge the quality of their models, and to develop appropriate terminology to communicate these judgments to the public whose health and safety may be at stake.},

abstract = {Many methods can be used to test alternative ground water models. Of concern in this work are methods able to (1) rank alternative models (also called model discrimination) and (2) identify observations important to parameter estimates and predictions (equivalent to the purpose served by some types of sensitivity analysis). Some of the measures investigated are computationally efficient; others are computationally demanding. The latter are generally needed to account for model nonlinearity. The efficient model discrimination methods investigated include the information criteria: the corrected Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, and generalized cross-validation. The efficient sensitivity analysis measures used are dimensionless scaled sensitivity (DSS), composite scaled sensitivity, and parameter correlation coefficient (PCC); the other statistics are DFBETAS, Cook's D, and observation-prediction statistic. Acronyms are explained in the introduction. Cross-validation (CV) is a computationally intensive nonlinear method that is used for both model discrimination and sensitivity analysis. The methods are tested using up to five alternative parsimoniously constructed models of the ground water system of the Maggia Valley in southern Switzerland. The alternative models differ in their representation of hydraulic conductivity. A new method for graphically representing CV and sensitivity analysis results for complex models is presented and used to evaluate the utility of the efficient statistics. The results indicate that for model selection, the information criteria produce similar results at much smaller computational cost than CV. For identifying important observations, the only obviously inferior linear measure is DSS; the poor performance was expected because DSS does not include the effects of parameter correlation and PCC reveals large parameter correlations.},

abstract = {Earth-orbiting spacecraft have become an integral part of everyone's lives. People depend on them for communications, weather forecasts, scientific research, and national security. A real and growing concern for the safety and reliability of these satellites is the threat from collision with other orbiting objects, including space debris. Even small particles can damage, degrade, or destroy spacecraft due to the very high velocities involved in a collision. The three principal counter measures to this threat that are being used are shielding, collision avoidance, and curtailment of the creation of new debris through design and operational practices. In addition to the obvious due diligence aspect of protecting operational spacecraft, one long-term benefit of collision avoidance is the prevention of collisions between two large objects, which in turn could further degrade near-Earth space with large numbers of new debris, as was the case with the collision of Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. On the other hand, over 99\% of the risk to operational spacecraft from collisions with orbital debris comes from objects too small to track on a routine basis, that is, smaller than 10 cm. Hence, only an improvement in the orbital debris environment itself can dramatically reduce the risks to operational spacecraft.},

abstract = {The recovery and processing of metals is one of the oldest recycling measures of mankind and the reasons for this are due to energy saving considerations and to the conservation of primary raw materials. Processes for the treatment of obsolete scrap metal have to be adapted to the most frequently used metals and metal mixtures. Size reduction as well as screen classification and separating procedures are the most common stages in scrap metal processing plants. In this chapter an overview is given showing the typical equipment for the handling of scrap metals. In this context the design and functioning principle of scrap shears as well as shredder and post-shredder plants are discussed. Finally, a new and highly sophisticated method for the segregation of waste metals - the so-called sensor based sorting - is discussed and explained.
This chapter describes the fundamentals of metal recycling. It considers the process of mechanical processing of scrap. These processes are all that is required to produce metals that can be used without any difficulties and without further treatment in metallurgical plants. These metallurgical processes include the machinery that is actually a part of the downstream equipment involved in smelting and refining and thus these processes complete the recycling loop for metals. Mechanical treatment of different waste streams containing metals involves the use of well-established methods, which, as a rule, is profitable because of the high market value of the recovered metals and also because metals do not change their properties with use and hence can be recycled an unlimited number of times. The main aim of the processing methods is to achieve high recovery values as well as the best possible grades of the final metallic products. Newly developed systems such as sensor-based sorters are increasingly being implemented to improve separation efficiencies. Finally, re-smelting of the reclaimed products constitutes the closing of the complete recycling loop for metals.},

abstract = {This chapter provides a brief introductory guide to the challenge of managing plastic solid waste (PSW) to its use as a material and an energy resource. PSW recycling processes can be classified in four major categories, re-extrusion (primary), mechanical (secondary), chemical (tertiary), and energy recovery (quaternary). Each method provides a unique set of advantages that makes it particularly beneficial for specific locations, applications or requirements. Increasing recovery of waste and diverting waste away from landfill play a key role in tackling the environmental impacts of increasing waste volumes. PSW not only represents a significant proportion of the total waste produced but also has the highest potential for energy recovery, having the highest calorific value when compared with other waste fractions. This chapter also presents a review of the current situation in the United Kingdom (UK), European Union (EU), and worldwide in relation to solid waste arising and strategies to address waste management. It also introduces the different routes for PSW management, namely, re-extrusion, mechanical recycling, and energy recovery. Petrochemical recovery via thermochemical treatment is also discussed and in particular some of the thermal treatment options available, namely, gasification, hydrogenation, and pyrolysis, are presented. Finally, it discusses a case study based on pyrolysis.},

abstract = {The management of biowaste has undergone significant changes during the last decade as environmental concerns and the need for sustainable use of resources continue to penetrate the public conscience. In this chapter, a systematic short description of commonly implemented sanitation systems is presented. It emphasizes that all reuse-oriented wastewater systems; whether low- or high-tech, have different strengths in contributing to sustainable biowaste management, depending on the specific context, and argues that the key issue as far as the reuse of wastewater is concerned is to collect and treat toilet flow streams (blackwater or dry faecal matter and urine) and wastewater (greywater) separately. The chapter shows how this approach has grown rapidly over the past years, with a clear message that future innovations will need increased focus on managing the solid fraction.
Biowaste management deals with solid waste management, focusing on reusing rather than disposing. There are three main lines of approaching the problem—high-tech systems based mainly on vacuum technology, membrane bioreactors, and biogas plants; urine diverting flush systems; and, finally, the very promising modern dry sanitation systems that can be very cost efficient and furthermore produce black soil and water that can be reused [terra preta sanitation (TPS)]. This chapter provides an overview to some of the different solutions. Integration of the anaerobic dry toilet and vermicomposting thus promises to be an ideal approach for managing wastes; even wastes generated by urban households. The product, terra preta, can address the problems of soil degradation and food insecurity, common in many areas across the world. TPS could become important in the design of highly efficient ecofriendly houses and housing areas with the added value of improved urban agriculture, which can be combined with local greywater reuse. Thus, TPS can close regional cycles and improve hygienic conditions and soil fertility in a sustainable manner with the creation of local added value. There are still questions to be answered such as the issue of macronutrients and also micronutrients.},

It also includes waste that enters waterways and rivers which flows into the sea and also waste from human habitation living in coastal areas close to the sea. Ocean waste can also result from ocean storms waves, tsunamis, and other extreme marine events. Some of these are the result of poor handling of cargo on ships and vessels. In some countries such as the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are responsible, along with the U.S. Navy and the Coast Guard and other agencies, for the management and control of ocean waste. The Inter-agency of the Marine Debris Coordinating Committee are responsible for the rules and regulation and recommendations for the handling this form of waste. In less developed nations such as Mexico, there are also incipient programs to handle ocean waste. It is important that progress be made in controlling waste discharges into the ocean.

The chapter highlights the variety of materials that are collected and the many collection options available (e.g. containers, vehicles, collection frequencies and methods). Waste collection problems and methods include: locating facilities (e.g. vehicle depots, waste disposal sites); sub-dividing rounds into districts for ease of operation and of optimisation; specifying the aggregation level for the collection points to be modelled (e.g. postcode, street, block) and then estimating the waste volume to be collected from each collection point; and optimising vehicle routes and schedules. The chapter concludes with four case study examples of modelling research results from around the world.
This chapter deals with the process of waste collection. It describes the waste materials that are collected, the collection systems that are typically used, and the types of vehicles and other equipment used. It also explains vehicle routing and scheduling, in terms of its capabilities, limitations, and data requirements, and provides some case study examples from around the world to give an indication of the range of waste collection problems and of what benefits may be achievable through the use of waste collection vehicle routing and scheduling methods. There are many different types and sources of waste, ranging from household garbage to debris found in outer space. This chapter focuses on the collection of municipal solid waste (MSW), which normally comprises waste from households, streets, parks, schools, hospitals, and some commercial businesses. Waste collection is a multi-faceted problem that can be considered at different levels, from the high level, strategic, policy or planning viewpoints, to more low level, tactical or operational decisions. It is very much in the interests of waste collection authorities (WCAs) worldwide to devise efficient working methods to keep their operating costs as low as possible while providing a good level of service to householders, trade customers, and other interested parties.},

abstract = {Nonhazardous industrial waste (NHIW) is distinct from both municipal solid waste (MSW), the more familiar mix from homes and businesses, and hazardous waste, materials that are more highly regulated owing to their toxicity and related public health concerns. The sheer quantities of NHIW raise the question of how best to manage it. The first defense is cleaner production—generating less waste by increasing industrial efficiency and effectiveness. A broad range of companies now produce annual sustainability reports detailing the amount of waste reduced in particular categories, year to year. For wastes that continue to be generated, many large volume industrial streams are amenable to separate handling such as foundry sand, coal ash, and paper mill sludge, some of these streams have an excellent track record for reuse. Specifically, industrial symbiosis is part of a new field called industrial ecology. Industrial ecology is principally concerned with the flow of materials and energy through systems at different scales, from products to factories and up to national and global levels. Industrial symbiosis focuses on these flows through networks of businesses and other organizations in local and regional economies as a means of approaching ecologically sustainable industrial development. It engages traditionally separate industries in a collective approach to competitive advantage involving physical exchange of materials, energy, water, and/or by-products. The keys to industrial symbiosis are collaboration and the synergistic possibilities offered by geographic proximity.},

abstract = {Organisms and ecosystems survive within a finite range of environmental conditions. One of the key factors in these conditions is the temperature range. From a waste management perspective, heat is both a friend and foe. When properly designed and operated, incinerators and other thermal technologies reduce municipal and industrial wastes in volume and change their physical and chemical properties to make these wastes less toxic and more easily manageable. However, if not operated properly, these same technologies can form very toxic chemical compounds. Thermal pollutants can affect the environment in every phase and environmental media. Heat may be a water pollutant if its addition directly or indirectly harms the biota living in surface wards. Complete destruction of a toxic compound versus the release of even more toxic compounds in an incinerator can be determined by a relatively small temperature range. Adding heat to a stream or other ecosystem can completely alter its biological integrity. Food chains and the health of human populations are affected by direct heating or by the indirect effects of added heat. Thus, waste management must always devote attention to these and other possible impacts from heat in the design and operation of systems.},

abstract = {This chapter approaches wastes from a life cycle perspective. The best waste is no waste at all, so the waste manager must look for opportunities to prevent the generation of wastes. One tool for identifying and characterizing wastes is the life cycle assessment, which considers products before they are manufactured and after they are disassembled. The energy and matter must be considered thermodynamically.
Traditionally, addressing wastes has often been a matter of reacting to problems as they arose individually in a situationally dependent way. However, the processes that lead to waste can be viewed much more proactively and systematically, with the focus now being on prevention. Engineers and other waste managers have begun to embrace waste minimization, pollution prevention, and other systematic approach, albeit incrementally. Green design and sustainable approaches to waste apply scientific principles to develop objective-oriented, function-based processes. They consider every element of a product's life cycle in a way that mutually benefits the client, the public, and the environment. Waste products can decrease in volume and mass as green designs replace traditional methods of manufacturing, use, and disposal. Wastes must be managed (and, ideally, avoided) by means of applying the laws of science. The better the designer understands these principles, the more likely that the products demanded by society can be produced and used predictably and sustainably. Therefore, strategic use of physical science laws must inform designs and engineering decisions, and forms the crux of green engineering and sustainable aspects of waste management.},

abstract = {In recent years a growing understanding has emerged regarding the need to expand the modeling paradigm to include conceptual model uncertainty for groundwater models. Conceptual model uncertainty is typically addressed by formulating alternative model conceptualizations and assessing their relative likelihoods using statistical model averaging approaches. Several model averaging techniques and likelihood measures have been proposed in the recent literature for this purpose with two broad categories--Monte Carlo-based techniques such as Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation or GLUE (Beven and Binley 1992) and criterion-based techniques that use metrics such as the Bayesian and Kashyap Information Criteria (e.g., the Maximum Likelihood Bayesian Model Averaging or MLBMA approach proposed by Neuman 2003) and Akaike Information Criterion-based model averaging (AICMA) (Poeter and Anderson 2005). These different techniques can often lead to significantly different relative model weights and ranks because of differences in the underlying statistical assumptions about the nature of model uncertainty. This paper provides a comparative assessment of the four model averaging techniques (GLUE, MLBMA with KIC, MLBMA with BIC, and AIC-based model averaging) mentioned above for the purpose of quantifying the impacts of model uncertainty on groundwater model predictions. Pros and cons of each model averaging technique are examined from a practitioner's perspective using two groundwater modeling case studies. Recommendations are provided regarding the use of these techniques in groundwater modeling practice.},

abstract = {Agriculture refers to the production of food material and related goods through farming. Like other facets of developmental activities, agriculture too has been a major source of environmental pollution and waste generation. In this context, this chapter provides an overview of the complexities of agricultural wastes, their impacts and possible options to manage them. Agricultural waste refers to waste produced as a result of various agricultural operations. It includes manure and other wastes from farms, poultry houses and slaughterhouses; harvest waste; fertilizer run- off from fields; pesticides that enter into water, air or soils; and salt and silt drained from fields. Agriculture management is a complex process involving individual attention to address the issues related to all functional components such as water, fertilizers, and biocides. A significant constraint encountered in managing agriculture waste is lack of data pertaining to different geographical regions. Therefore, the urgent need is to formulate a tangible mechanism to create an international database on the quantity, composition and characteristics of agro wastes. Preparation of a compendium flagging the success stories and challenges in respect of developed and developing economies would serve well for officials in governance and on the field.},

abstract = {The use of fibers and fiber containing goods is widespread. The main end-applications comprise apparel as well as home furnishing. Because fibers can be found in a great variety of products, it is to be expected that fibers end up in diverse waste streams. Waste is increasingly being seen as (secondary) raw material, and zero waste represents the current ideal in waste management. Fibers and fiber containing products have followed the same trend towards sustainability. Because fiber production and textile processing are sophisticated and demands large amounts of energy, reuse and recycling are highly recommended, not only for ecological reasons but also for economic reasons. Unfortunately, because fiber reprocessing is difficult and complex, a large portion of fibrous waste still ends up in landfill sites or, largely based on legislative forces, in waste incinerators. A variety of methods do exist for treating waste and end-of-life textiles. Legislation plays an important role in the treatment of waste. From an economical point of view, textile waste exhibits an exceptional position. Zero waste is an extensively used keyword today. It refers to the reuse and recycling of waste and the avoidance of landfilling and combustion. Finally, environmental and ethical attitudes can significantly influence waste treatment.},

abstract = {Paper is probably the most commonly recycled material in use today and has been reused in the papermaking process since the industrialization of the process in the early nineteen century. Although over 60\% of all paper produced in the United States is recovered, paper still makes up over 30\% of the municipal solid waste stream. Because of its high recovery rate, recovered paper is as important a raw material for papermaking as is chemically pulped virgin fiber. Recovered paper comes from a number of different sources, including postconsumer paper, which is recycled after it has served its useful purpose. Because of the wide variety of paper that is recovered, a number of organizations have standardized recovered paper grades in terms of the quality and cleanliness of the material. Paper recycling will continue long into the future as it is a key raw material in the papermaking process.
Recovered paper, or waste paper, can come from a number of different sources, including internally at the paper mill. A number of different terms are used to indicate when in the life cycle of the paper that it is returned for recycling. Recovered paper collection is done in a number of different ways, depending on the type of paper being collected and the source of the paper. In general, preconsumer recycled paper is easier to collect as it tends to be concentrated in specific manufacturing locations and also tends to be much more homogeneous. These collections, often of the form of cuttings, trimmings and over issues, are typically baled and packaged directly at the collection site with little additional processing needed. Paper recycling is a key raw material for the papermaking process, representing a significant portion of the fiber used. However, because of the degradation of the fibers through the papermaking and recycling process, the limit to the amount of paper being recycled is slowly being approached. In addition, there are a number of grades of paper that are currently not recycled and will not be in the foreseeable future. This is particularly true for such personal care products such as toweling and tissue. Future improvements in recycling will need to deal mainly with the fiber quality issues.},

While the goal of mathematical modeling in cognitive psychology is to select one model from a set of competing models that best captures the underlying mental process, choosing the model that best fits a particular set of data will not achieve this goal. This is because a highly complex model can provide a good fit without necessarily bearing any interpretable relationship with the underlying process. It is shown that model selection based solely on the fit to observed data will result in the choice of an unnecessarily complex model that overfits the data, and thus generalizes poorly. The effect of over-fitting must be properly offset by model selection methods. An application example of selection methods using artificial data is also presented. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management is dynamic, especially in evolving technology and policy changes. This chapter incorporates the basic issues, such as waste generation and composition, treatment and disposal, including illegal dumping, as well as, the challenges and issues of MSW management. Current topics of relevance, included in the chapter, are waste management and climate change, which explains the need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from this sector. Also important is marine pollution by MSW and its impact on marine life around small island nations. Lastly, an explicit discussion on the policy and regulations is elucidated to explore the main causes of the MSW management challenges, particularly in developing and transitory nations.
Municipal solid waste (MSW) is an inevitable by-product of human activity. It includes all wastes generated within a municipality. However, the definitions differ from country to country. In some developing nations, industrial waste and fecal material, though normally not considered as part of MSW, are often found in MSW and, thus, disposed together in normal landfills. MSW refers to all wastes generated, collected, transported, and disposed of within the jurisdiction of a municipal authority. In most cases, it comprises mainly food waste, and rubbish from residential areas, street sweepings, commercial and institutional nonhazardous wastes as well as (in some countries) construction and demolition waste. MSW management incorporates several interrelated aspects, which needs complete cooperation and collaboration for efficient delivery. It comprises aspects of waste generation, waste composition, collection, recycling (if any), pretreatment and treatment, and finally, disposal. These management aspects thus require input from legal, economic, governmental, political, administrative, and environmental players. Thus, it requires the involvement of multiprofessional drivers, and at times, the failure of one component is sufficient to cause the whole management to collapse. The management structure and function is site-specific and depends on socioeconomic, behavioral, cultural, institutional, and political frameworks. These stakeholders need to interact and cooperate for the management system to achieve its target.},

These and other human activities lead to the release of chemical contaminants, but they also result in landscape damage, such as soil erosion, habitat destruction, and loss of resources, such as wetlands and coastal ecosystems. Plans must include measures to complement the natural and cultural environment and to avoid destruction or adverse alteration of the land. This means that good practice should always consider approaches to minimize impacts of construction, development, and facility operation on the surrounding watershed, by preventing water pollution and actions that disrupt natural drainage patterns. In addition, land use planning must directly address habitat destruction by recommending ways that any development conserve land that serves as habitat for native flora and fauna, both on- and off-site, and directly and indirectly. Another special consideration for land development is the presence of threatened or endangered species and the potential that their habitats may be affected by developing a site. Wasting land by losing it through erosion, diminishing its beneficial uses, and contaminating it is wholly unacceptable. Protecting land relies on sound application of not only the physical and natural sciences but also the social sciences. Where people choose to live is based on environmental quality and sociological and psychological factors. Land use planners, engineers, and waste managers each have vital roles in preventing and addressing land pollution.},

Simplicity is often represented by parameter counts; the fewer the parameters, the simpler the model. Arguments are presented here suggesting that simplicity has little place in discussions of modeling; instead, the concept of flexibility should be substituted. When comparing two models one should be wary of the possibility of their differential flexibility. Several methods for assessing relative flexibility are possible, as represented in this special issue of the Journal of Mathematical Psychology. Here, the method of cross-validation is applied in the comparison of two models, a linear integration model (LIM) and the fuzzy-logical model of perception (FLMP), in the fitting of 44 data sets concerning the perception of layout seen among three panels with the presence or absence of four sources of information for depth. Prior to cross-validation the two models performed about equally well; after cross-validation LIM was statistically superior to FLMP, but the overall pattern of fits remained nearly the same for both models.

abstract = {The global glass production in 2007 was approximately 135 million tonnes, of which container and flat glass glass accounted for 72 and 44 million tonnes respectively. The main environmental impacts from producing glass products are the high energy use in batch melting and resulting gaseous emissions. Whilst glass container re-use and closed loop recycling have their own environmental burdens, they can nevertheless significantly reduce energy use and resultant emissions. A comparison of global consumption and recycling volumes demonstrates a potential reduction of 54 × 106 GJ in energy use and 8.3 × 106 t a-1 CO2 emissions based on an 80\% overall global recycling rate, compared with the rate achieved in 2007. The core challenge in realising this potential is the maintenance and enhancement of recycling infrastructures to produce high quality manufacturing ready cullet, combined with a balanced demand from closed loop production facilities.
This chapter explores the environmental issues arising from glass production and consumption. Glass is in the background of the daily lives of most people. The potential for glass recycling comes largely from the container and flat glass sectors, because of their dominance in terms of mass, and their relatively uniform chemical composition, with soda lime–silica glass accounting for virtually all the container and flat glass produced. The main environmental impacts in glass making are the high-energy use in batch melting, and the resultant gaseous emissions from fuel combustion and the heat reaction of components of the batch mix. The core challenge for environmentally and cost-effective recycling of container glass arises from the dispersed nature of its sources, principally households, and the consequent need for an environmentally and cost-effective infrastructure providing for its color separation, collection, and transportation to processors to produce furnace ready feedstock. In assessing the scope for increasing the amount of glass recycled, there is an overall need to quantify the resultant energy and other environmental burdens to allow valid comparisons to be made with the burdens of using virgin feedstock.},

abstract = {Risk is a common metric for waste management. Societal expectations of acceptable risk are mandated by the standards and specifications of certifying authorities. Articulating the hazard (the agent of harm) is matched against the ways that people or other receptors may come into contact with that hazard, that is, exposure. Thus, risk management includes the policies, laws, and other societal endeavors that limit these two components of risk. From the hazard perspectives, regulatory agencies may decide that a product is too hazardous when it is manufactured, used, or when it becomes a waste product. Thus, the hazard may occur before a waste is generated, such as a component of a manufacturing process. Waste management success is a function of the amount of risk that has been reduced or avoided. Thus, the success of all waste operations is, to some extent, a reflection of the operation's hazards and potential exposures to these hazards. Decisions must be based on scientifically credible information. This information is part of the risk assessment that informs waste management decisions.},

HHW is a small proportion of the municipal waste stream, but the potential risks to the environment and health are disproportionate to its size. Although estimates of the amount of HHW vary from region to region and across national boundaries, it generally comprises 1–4\% of municipal solid waste (MSW). Internationally, most HHW is co-disposed with MSW to municipal waste landfills. Co-disposal of potentially hazardous wastes can lead to an increase in hazard status; not only are these substances potentially dangerous to the environment and health, but they can also induce changes in other waste streams by reacting directly with the waste or by altering the redox environment. Landfill simulations, based on current MSW disposal patterns, reveal the risk to the environment from leakage of potentially hazardous materials from landfills to be small but existent. There is a growing tendency for waste disposal authorities to make provision for the separate collection of many items of HHW. The increased cost of separate HHW collection and disposal must be considered alongside the new environmental and health risks posed by changes to disposal practice and the general trend of reduced hazardous content of most consumer goods.},

abstract = {Many long-lived radionuclides are present in groundwater at the Nevada Test Site (NTS) as a result of 828 underground nuclear weapons tests conducted between 1951 and 1992. In conjunction with a comprehensive geochemical review of radionuclides (3H, 14C, 36Cl, 99Tc and 129I) that are presumably mobile in the subsurface, we synthesized a body of radionuclide activity data measured from groundwater samples collected at 18 monitoring wells, to qualitatively assess their migration at the NTS over distances of hundreds of meters and over timescales of decades. Tritium and 36Cl showed little evidence of retardation, while the transport of 14C may have been retarded by its isotopic exchange with carbonate minerals in the aquifer. Observed local reducing conditions (either natural or test-induced) will impact the mobility of certain redox-sensitive radionuclides (especially 99Tc) that were otherwise soluble and readily transported under oxidizing conditions. Conversely, strongly oxidizing conditions may impact the mobility of 129I which is mobile under reducing conditions. The effect of iodine speciation on its transport deserves further attention. Indication of delayed transport of some "mobile" radionuclides (especially 99Tc) in the groundwater at the NTS suggested the importance of redox conditions of the natural system in controlling the fate and transport of radionuclides, which has implications in the enhanced performance of the potential Yucca Mountain repository, located adjacent to the NTS, to store high-level nuclear wastes as well as management of radionuclide contamination in legacy nuclear operations facilities.},

abstract = {The present study demonstrates a methodology for optimization of environmental data acquisition. Based on the premise that the worth of data increases in proportion to its ability to reduce the uncertainty of key model predictions, the methodology can be used to compare the worth of different data types, gathered at different locations within study areas of arbitrary complexity. The method is applied to a hypothetical nonlinear, variable density numerical model of salt and heat transport. The relative utilities of temperature and concentration measurements at different locations within the model domain are assessed in terms of their ability to reduce the uncertainty associated with predictions of movement of the salt water interface in response to a decrease in fresh water recharge. In order to test the sensitivity of the method to nonlinear model behavior, analyses were repeated for multiple realizations of system properties. Rankings of observation worth were similar for all realizations, indicating robust performance of the methodology when employed in conjunction with a highly nonlinear model. The analysis showed that while concentration and temperature measurements can both aid in the prediction of interface movement, concentration measurements, especially when taken in proximity to the interface at locations where the interface is expected to move, are of greater worth than temperature measurements. Nevertheless, it was also demonstrated that pairs of temperature measurements, taken in strategic locations with respect to the interface, can also lead to more precise predictions of interface movement.},

abstract = {The hazardous attributes of the waste are usually based on its inherent physicochemical properties, including its likelihood to ignite, explode, and react with water. The hazardous inherent properties of a waste can also be biological, such as the infectious nature of medical wastes, or a chemical compound that has been shown to elicit acute effects, for example skin irritations and chronic effects, such as cancer; harm to the endocrine, immune, or nervous system; interference with tissue development and reproduction; or mutations, birth defects, or other toxic endpoints. Hazardous waste management involves reducing the amount of hazardous substances produced, treating hazardous wastes to reduce their toxicity, and applying sound engineering controls to reduce or eliminate exposures to these wastes. Waste-treatment technologies include physical treatment, chemical treatment, biological treatment, incineration, and solidification or stabilization treatment. The selection of the most effective technology depends on the characteristics of the wastes being treated. Similarly, the characteristics of the media in need of treatment determine the performance of any contaminant treatment or control. These processes recycle and reuse waste materials, reduce the volume and toxicity of a waste stream, or produce a final residual material that is suitable for disposal.},

abstract = {A framework is provided for scaling and scale issues in hydrology. The first section gives some basic definitions. This is important as researchers do not seem to have agreed on the meaning of concepts such as scale or upscaling. ‘Process scale’, ‘observation scale’ and ‘modelling (working) scale’ require different definitions. The second section discusses heterogeneity and variability in catchments and touches on the implications of randomness and organization for scaling. The third section addresses the linkages across scales from a modelling point of view. It is argued that up- scaling typically consists of two steps: distributing and aggregating. Conversely, downscaling involves disaggregation and singling out. Different approaches are discussed for linking state variables, parameters, inputs and conceptual- izations across scales. This section also deals with distributed parameter models, which are one way of linking con- ceptualizations across scales. The fourth section addresses the linkages across scales from a more holistic perspective dealing with dimensional analysis and similarity concepts. The main difference to the modelling point of view is that dimensional analysis and similarity concepts deal with complex processes in a much simpler fashion. Examples of dimensional analysis, similarity analysis and functional normalization in catchment hydrology are given. This section also briefly discusses fractals, which are a popular tool for quantifying variability across scales. The fifth section focuses on one particular aspect of this holistic view, discussing stream network analysis. The paper concludes with identifying key issues and gives some directions for future research.},

abstract = {This paper argues that there are fundamental problems in the application of physically-based models for practical prediction in hydrology. These problems result from limitations of the model equations relative to a heterogeneous reality; the lack of a theory of subgrid scale integration; practical constraints on solution methodologies; and problems of dimensionality in parameter calibration. It is suggested that most current applications of physically-based models use them as lumped conceptual models at the grid scale. Recent papers on physically-based models have misunderstood and misrepresented these limitations. There are practical hydrological problems requiring physically-based predictions, and there will continue to be a need for physically-based models but ideas about their capabilities must change so that future applications attempt to obtain realistic estimates of the uncertainty associated with their predictions, particularly in the case of evaluating future scenarios of the effects of management strategies.},

"Preface Waste: A Handbook of Waste Management is designed to be a resource for the designer, practitioner, researcher, teacher and student. Waste is one of those entities which is defined by everyone, but not truly and completely understood by anyone. The scientist, engineer and consumer each define waste correctly, yet differently. The overriding challenge for the authors was to provide some uniformity, yet allow for the diversity of the various aspects of waste in this handbook. After all, a handbook is often the beginning of the search for information, certainly not the end. We have borrowed from all scientific disciplines, and a few humanities, to arrive at a balanced resource. And, indeed, balance is the key to environmental science and engineering"--},

That book contained more statistical data confirming his theories. Over the next five years Snow continued his research, publishing a second edition of the book in 1855. This was so greatly revised and expanded that it was essentially a new work. In it Snow set forth his views of the etiology and spread of cholera, which he believed to be caused by a living organism (a belief confirmed by Koch's discovery of the cholera vibrio in 1883), and included statistical surveys made during the great cholera epidemic of 1854, demonstrating that the number of cholera deaths in each area of southern London corresponded to the degree of contamination of the local drinking water. This 1855 edition was the first to tell the dramatic story of the Broad Street pump, which, after contamination with sewage from a nearby pipe, caused 500 cholera deaths within the space of ten days. Once the epidemic had peaked, Snow persuaded the parish councilors to remove the pump handle, and the number of cholera attacks decreased rapidly. Snow's report of the Broad Street epidemic included a spot-map of the district showing the location of each pump and fatal cholera cases-- the first use of a spot-map in epidemiology.--J.

The data are necessary to enable the development of conceptual and numerical models, parameter estimation, and multiple simulations. We designed a methodology based on DOE Savannah River Site F - Area and Hanford databases that included well layout, concentration, groundwater level, lithology, meteorological records, contaminant levels, etc. The approach was necessary to effectively manage the staging and views of environmental data to ensure that site characterization and monit oring data are readily available as inputs for parameter estimation, numerical predictions, uncertainty quantification, and risk analysis. This paper describes the methodology and the application of the developed data management system to the Savannah Rive r F - Area site observations. In particular, we present methods for organizing different databases and data types into a common framework that allows the user to browse the data as a single coherent dataset. A nalyses of the Savannah River F - area using the da ta management system illustrate the utility of the system . The paper also demonstrates the utility of interfaces designed to leverage and integrate existing large - scale data management, provenance and indexing technologies from the scientific community and discuss the next steps.},

The book begins with a classic account of the characteristics, progress, and political, economic and social implications of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, France and Germany. Professor Landes here raises the much-debated question: why was Europe the first to industrialise? He then charts the economic history of the twentieth-century: the effect of the First World War in accelerating the dissolution of the old international economy; the economic crisis of 1929-32; Europe's recovery and unprecedented economic growth following the Second World War. He concludes that only by continuous industrial revolution can Europe and the world sustain itself in the years ahead.},

Striking similarities are observed for natural and optimal networks in their fractal aggregation structure and in certain multifractal structures found to be characteristic of river basins. Our results suggest, upon critical assessment of the reliability of the identification of the attractor of the underlying dynamics implied by our optimality concepts, that fractal structures are indeed possibly a product of least energy dissipation. Power laws emerging in the description of the distribution of aggregated quantities from both DEMs and OCNs suggest a link with the framework of self-organized criticality in the dynamics of natural channel network formation. Also, the geomorphological description of OCNs reveals surprising analogies with well-known empirical or experimental results, A comparison of Peano's basins with OCNs suggests that nature seems to reject the type of strict self-similarity exhibited by Peano's construct in favor of different shapes implying statistical self-similarity not only because of chance acting through random conditions but also because of necessity as reflected by least energy expenditure considerations.},

@book{Mokyr1990,
abstract = {In a world of supercomputers, genetic engineering, and fiber optics, technological creativity is ever more the key to economic success. But why are some nations more creative than others, and why do some highly innovative societies--such as ancient China, or Britain in the industrial revolution--pass into stagnation? Beginning with a fascinating, concise history of technological progress, Mokyr sets the background for his analysis by tracing the major inventions and innovations that have transformed society since ancient Greece and Rome. What emerges from this survey is often surprising: the classical world, for instance, was largely barren of new technology, the relatively backward society of medieval Europe bristled with inventions, and the period between the Reformation and the Industrial Revolution was one of slow and unspectacular progress in technology, despite the tumultuous developments associated with the Voyages of Discovery and the Scientific Revolution. What were the causes of technological creativity? Mokyr distinguishes between the relationship of inventors and their physical environment--which determined their willingness to challenge nature--and the social environment, which determined the openness to new ideas. He discusses a long list of such factors, showing how they interact to help or hinder a nation's creativity, and then illustrates them by a number of detailed studies taken from the history of Europe and China. He examines such aspects as the role of the state (the Chinese gave up a millenium-wide lead in shipping to the Europeans, for example, when an Emperor banned large ocean-going vessels), the impact of science, as well as religion, politics, and even nutrition. He questions the importance of such commonly-cited factors as the spill-over benefits of war, the abundance of of natural resources, life expectancy, and labor costs. And he presents startlingly novel explanations of why China lost its dramatic lead in technology to Europe, why medieval Europe was technologically more creative than Classical Antiquity, and why Britain left the rest of the world behind during the Industrial Revolution only to lose its leadership a century later. Today, an ever greater number of industrial economies are competing in the global market, locked in a struggle that revolves around technological ingenuity. Lever of Riches, with its keen analysis derived from a sweeping survey of creativity throughout history, offers telling insight into the question of how Western economies can maintain, and developing nations can unlock, their creative potential.},

@incollection{Cui2011a,
abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of electronic waste, current status of the management of electronic waste (e-waste), and recycling technologies for the recovery of metals from end-of-life electronic equipment. Because of the ever increasing generation of e-waste and the hazardous nature of this waste stream, e-waste is an emerging issue. Many countries have drafted legislation to improve the reuse, recycling, and other forms of recovery of such waste. Electronic waste is significantly heterogeneous and complex in terms of the type of components and materials. However, copper and precious metals make up more than 80\% of the value for most of the e-waste samples. This indicates that the recovery of precious metals and copper may remain as the major economic driver for a long time. The hierarchy of treatment of e-waste encourages the reuse of the whole equipment first, remanufacturing, then recovery of materials by recycling techniques, and as a last resort, disposal by incineration and landfilling. Recycling of e-waste can be broadly divided into three major steps—selective disassembly, targeting, and singling out hazardous or valuable components for special treatment; mechanical and metallurgical processing to upgrade desirable materials content; and refining recovered materials that are retreated or purified by using chemical (metallurgical) processing so as to be acceptable for further use in their original application.},

@article{Bamber2000,
abstract = {Formal definitions are given of the following intuitive concepts: (a) A model is quantitatively testable if its predictions are highly precise and narrow. (b) A model is identifiable if the values of its parameters can be ascertained from empirical observations. (c) A model is redundant if the values of some parameters can be deduced from others or if the values of some observables can be deduced from others. Various rules of thumb for nonredundant models are examined. The Counting Rule states that a model is quantitatively testable if and only if it has fewer parameters than observables. This rule can be safely applied only to identifiable models. If a model is unidentifiable, one must apply a generalization of the Counting Rule known as the Jacobian Rule. This rule states that a model is quantitatively testable if and only if the maximum rank (i.e., the number of linearly independent columns) of its Jacobian matrix (i.e., the matrix of partial derivatives of the function that maps parameter values to the predicted values of observables) is smaller than the number of observables. The Identifiability Rule states that a model is identifiable if and only if the maximum rank of its Jacobian matrix equals the number of parameters. The conclusions provided by these rules are only presumptive. To reach definitive conclusions, additional analyses must be performed. To illustrate the foregoing, the quantitative testability and identifiability of linear models and of discrete-state models are analyzed. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},
