@book{Reed2003,
abstract = {This attractive book presents the history of the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site in South Carolina site from its creation in 1950 to 2000; the site was an important part of the nuclear complex of the United States. The book provides details of the construction and operation of nuclear reactors and associated facilities, as well as their decommissioning and the management of nuclear waste at the site. The contents detail the influence on the site of developments in nuclear science, the Cold War, environmental concerns, and domestic politics. The social and economic effects of the site on its region are also described. Numerous photographs, diagrams, and maps enrich the interesting narrative. The text includes descriptions of reactor technology and chemical separations developed at the site to improve the production of plutonium, heavy water, and tritium for the United States nuclear weapons program. The volume also includes a chronology, biographies of site managers, and an extensive set of endnotes. The book is published by the U.S. Department of Energy and therefore presents a single view of the Savannah River Site story.},
