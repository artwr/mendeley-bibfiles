abstract = {In contrast to many other engineering fields, the uncertainties in subsurface processes (e.g., fluid flow and contaminant transport in aquifers) and their parameters are notoriously difficult to observe, measure, and characterize. This causes severe uncertainties that need to be addressed in any decision analysis related to optimal management and remediation of groundwater contamination sites. Furthermore, decision analyses typically rely heavily on complex data analyses and/or model predictions, which are often poorly constrained as well. Recently, we have developed a model-driven decision-support framework (called MADS; http://mads.lanl.gov) for the management and remediation of subsurface contamination sites in which severe uncertainties and complex physics-based models are coupled to perform scientifically defensible decision analyses. The decision analyses are based on Information Gap Decision Theory (IGDT). We demonstrate the MADS capabilities by solving a decision problem related to optimal monitoring network design.},

@article{Hunt2007,
abstract = {The idea that models should be as simple as possible is often accepted without question. However, too much simplification and parsimony may degrade a model’s utility. Models are often constructed to make predictions; yet, they are commonly parameterized with a focus on calibration, regardless of whether (1) the calibration data can constrain simulated predictions or (2) the number and type of calibration parameters are commensurate with the hydraulic property details on which key predictions may depend. Parameterization estimated through the calibration process is commonly limited by the necessity that the number of calibration parameters be smaller than the number of observations. This limitation largely stems from historical restrictions in calibration and computing capability; we argue here that better methods and computing capabilities are now available and should become more widely used. To make this case, two approaches to model calibration are contrasted: (1) a traditional approach based on a small number of homogeneous parameter zones defined by the modeler a priori and (2) regularized inversion, which includes many more parameters than the traditional approach. We discuss some advantages of regularized inversion, focusing on the increased insight that can be gained from calibration data. We present these issues using reasoning that we believe has a common sense appeal to modelers; knowledge of mathematics is not required to follow our arguments. We present equations in an Appendix, however, to illustrate the fundamental differences between traditional model calibration and a regularized inversion approach.},

@article{Yakirevich2013,
abstract = {Abstract Improving understanding of chemical transport in the subsurface commonly employs evolving groundwater monitoring networks. The objective of this work was to apply the information theory to propose an objective algorithm for augmenting a subsurface monitoring network (SMN) with the purpose of discrimination of conceptually different subsurface flow and transport models. This method determines new monitoring locations where the Kullback-Leibler total information gain is maximized. The latter is computed based on estimates of the uncertainty in modeling results and uncertainty in observations. The method was applied to discriminate models in 1) a synthetic case of groundwater contamination from a point source; 2) the tracer experiment conducted at the USDA-ARS OPE3 research site where a pulse of KCL solution was applied with irrigation water and CL- concentrations were subsequently monitored. Models were compared that included or ignored the effect of subsurface soil lenses on chemical transport Pedotransfer functions were used to develop the ensemble of models for estimating the uncertainty in modeling results obtained with the numerical 3D flow and transport model. Peak tracer breakthrough concentrations were used to define the information gains. The determination of the new locations to augment existing ones was conducted on a 2-D grid. The information gain peaked in narrow area, and additional observation locations were very well spatially defined. Well-calibrated models provided a single optimal location, whereas, if models were not calibrated well, the Bayesian estimates of the new observation location depended on the activation sequence assumed for existing locations. The information gain maximization can suggest data collection locations to reduce uncertainties in the conceptual models of subsurface flow and transport.},

@article{Jakeman1993,
abstract = {Development of mathematical models relating the precipitation incident upon a catchment to the streamflow emanating from the catchment has been a major focus of surface water hydrology for decades. Generally, values for parameters in such models must be selected so that runoff calculated from the model “matches” recorded runoff from some historical period. Despite the fact that the physics governing the path of a drop of water through a catchment to the stream involves complex relationships, evidence indicates that the information content in a rainfall-runoff record is sufficient to support models of only very limited complexity. This begs the question of what limits the observed data place on the allowable complexity of rainfall-runoff models. Time series techniques are applied for estimating transfer functions to determine how many parameters are appropriate to describe the relationship between precipitation and streamflow in the case where data on only precipitation, air temperature, and streamflow are available. Statistics from an “information matrix” provide the clues necessary for determining allowable model complexity. Time series models are developed for seven catchments with widely varying physical characteristics in different temperate climatic regimes to demonstrate the method. It is found that after modulating the measured rainfall using a nonlinear loss function, the rainfall-runoff response of all catchments is well represented using a linear model. Also, for all catchments a two-component linear model with four parameters is the model of choice. The two components can be interpreted as defining a “quick flow” and “slow flow” response of the given catchment. The method therefore provides a statistically rigorous way to separate hydrographs and parameterize their response behavior. The ability to construct reliable transfer function models for describing the rainfall-runoff process offers a new approach to investigate empirically the controls of physical catchment descriptors, land use change, climate change, etc., on the dynamic response of catchments through the extensive analysis of historical data sets.},
