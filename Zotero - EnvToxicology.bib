abstract = {Most chemical pesticides in use today were discovered along conventional lines of research, primarily via empirical synthesis and screening followed by structure-activity relation optimization. The very rapid rise in the cost of research, the decreasing success rate for a commercial pesticide from this approach, and the ever-increasing regulatory requirements for registration suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on more rational methods for discovering new chemical pesticides. Rational leads can be discovered from several research approaches, including the synthetic modifications of natural product models, the development of metabolic disrupters or enhancers of some process in the target pests, and the development of innovative effective bioassays to discover subtle agents such as behaviour modifiers and chitin synthesis blockers. In our research programmes, we have extensively investigated juvenile hormone agonists and antagonists. These two areas probably best exemplify the biorational aspects of the discovery of highly selective insecticidal agents. One of our current goals is to develop chemical antagonists of juvenile hormone in lepidopterous larvae, which will result in biochemical and/or morphogenetic disturbances in the insect similar to those elicited by surgical removal of the corpora allata.},
