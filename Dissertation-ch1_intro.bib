abstract = {This attractive book presents the history of the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site in South Carolina site from its creation in 1950 to 2000; the site was an important part of the nuclear complex of the United States. The book provides details of the construction and operation of nuclear reactors and associated facilities, as well as their decommissioning and the management of nuclear waste at the site. The contents detail the influence on the site of developments in nuclear science, the Cold War, environmental concerns, and domestic politics. The social and economic effects of the site on its region are also described. Numerous photographs, diagrams, and maps enrich the interesting narrative. The text includes descriptions of reactor technology and chemical separations developed at the site to improve the production of plutonium, heavy water, and tritium for the United States nuclear weapons program. The volume also includes a chronology, biographies of site managers, and an extensive set of endnotes. The book is published by the U.S. Department of Energy and therefore presents a single view of the Savannah River Site story.},

abstract = {Reconstructing the progression of geographical understanding has an important role in current environmental litigation. Determining damages for past contamination of groundwater by surface discharges of hazardous substances requires knowledge of developments in groundwater hydrology. A review of the scientific literature on the motion of subsurface fluids, public health, and sanitary engineering indicates that by 1940 knowledge was sufficient to argue against surface discharges of harmful fluids. Legal precedent, though inconsistent, proved there was ample awareness of the physical processes and financial liabilities before 1950 to expect careful disposal of liquid wastes to a land surface.},

abstract = {Since the advent of the modern nuclear age in the 1940’s, man has effectively managed the often hazardous waste produced by nuclear processes. Expansion of nuclear energy worldwide is likely to meet increased power demands and greenhouse gas reduction targets and will result in increased radioactive waste generation. Managing this waste effectively is a critical component of a world-wide “nuclear renaissance.” Past practice has proven the wastes generated from nuclear power generation can be effectively managed using technologies that are well demonstrated at industrial scales, with decades of safe operating practices. Emphasis is necessary to ensure that future nuclear fuel cycles remain economically and environmentally competitive (as compared to other forms of energy production) and do not produce legacy waste management issues for future generations. This chapter discusses the history of nuclear waste management and provides the current “state-of-the-art” for management of all forms of nuclear waste.
Expansion of nuclear energy worldwide is necessary to meet increased power demands and greenhouse gas reduction targets. Virtually any international energy forecast predicts large growth in nuclear power generation over the next 30–50 years. The expansion of commercial nuclear power production is likely to result in increased radioactive waste generation. Managing this waste effectively is a critical component of a worldwide nuclear renaissance and is a primary consideration for future nuclear fuel cycles. Wastes generated from nuclear power generation can be effectively managed using technologies that are well demonstrated at industrial scales, with decades of safe operating practices. As the worldwide community continues to investigate advanced nuclear fuel cycles, radioactive waste management considerations are being given increased emphasis and are, in fact, being considered at the advent of proposed fuel cycles. This emphasis is necessary to ensure that future nuclear fuel cycles remain economically and environmentally competitive (as compared with other forms of energy production) and do not produce legacy waste management issues for future generations.},

"Preface Waste: A Handbook of Waste Management is designed to be a resource for the designer, practitioner, researcher, teacher and student. Waste is one of those entities which is defined by everyone, but not truly and completely understood by anyone. The scientist, engineer and consumer each define waste correctly, yet differently. The overriding challenge for the authors was to provide some uniformity, yet allow for the diversity of the various aspects of waste in this handbook. After all, a handbook is often the beginning of the search for information, certainly not the end. We have borrowed from all scientific disciplines, and a few humanities, to arrive at a balanced resource. And, indeed, balance is the key to environmental science and engineering"--},

That book contained more statistical data confirming his theories. Over the next five years Snow continued his research, publishing a second edition of the book in 1855. This was so greatly revised and expanded that it was essentially a new work. In it Snow set forth his views of the etiology and spread of cholera, which he believed to be caused by a living organism (a belief confirmed by Koch's discovery of the cholera vibrio in 1883), and included statistical surveys made during the great cholera epidemic of 1854, demonstrating that the number of cholera deaths in each area of southern London corresponded to the degree of contamination of the local drinking water. This 1855 edition was the first to tell the dramatic story of the Broad Street pump, which, after contamination with sewage from a nearby pipe, caused 500 cholera deaths within the space of ten days. Once the epidemic had peaked, Snow persuaded the parish councilors to remove the pump handle, and the number of cholera attacks decreased rapidly. Snow's report of the Broad Street epidemic included a spot-map of the district showing the location of each pump and fatal cholera cases-- the first use of a spot-map in epidemiology.--J.

Now, in this new edition, the author reframes and reasserts his original arguments in the light of current debates about globalisation and comparative economic growth. The book begins with a classic account of the characteristics, progress, and political, economic and social implications of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, France and Germany. Professor Landes here raises the much-debated question: why was Europe the first to industrialise? He then charts the economic history of the twentieth-century: the effect of the First World War in accelerating the dissolution of the old international economy; the economic crisis of 1929-32; Europe's recovery and unprecedented economic growth following the Second World War. He concludes that only by continuous industrial revolution can Europe and the world sustain itself in the years ahead.},
