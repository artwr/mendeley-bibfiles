@techreport{Qaddumi2009,
abstract = {Climate change is real, and taking prudent measures to plan for and adapt to climate change must become an integral part of the Bank's water practice. There is now ample evidence that increased hydrologic variability and change in climate has and will continue have a profound impact on the water sector through the hydrologic cycle, water availability, water demand, and water allocation at the global, regional, basin, and local levels. This report and the analytical work leading to it are focused on key topics related to the impact of climate change on the water cycle and water investments. This report contributes to the World Bank agenda on climate change and more specifically, informs the water sector investments on climate issues and climate-smart adaptation options. Using the existing knowledge and additional analysis commissioned. The report illustrates that climate change is affecting the hydrologic cycle and the projected future hydrology will have a direct impact on the water resources base availability, usage, and management. Depending on the type of the water investment, this impact can be positive, negative, or neutral. The report addresses the stress on and vulnerability of the water systems through use of reliability, resilience, and robustness as the key indicators of sensitivity of water systems for climate induced failure. Current practices in the sector are examined in order to better understand the state-of-the-science for incorporating current and future variability and change in hydrology and climate in the Bank's portfolio for project planning and design. New and innovative practices taking into account adaptation options for water systems and risk-based decision making in water investments are reviewed and assessed for application to investments in infrastructure. The climate change dimension is placed within the context of the impact of other factors (within and outside the sector) such as population growth (and associated increase in demand) and land management (particularly as related to water), which in some cases may be far more significant and critical than that of climate change in some parts of the world. Finally, recommendations for a progressive agenda on water and climate change are made.},

@book{Snow1855,
abstract = {Snow expanded his reports on his cholera research in a book entitled On the Mode of Communication of Cholera published in London the same year. That book contained more statistical data confirming his theories. Over the next five years Snow continued his research, publishing a second edition of the book in 1855. This was so greatly revised and expanded that it was essentially a new work. In it Snow set forth his views of the etiology and spread of cholera, which he believed to be caused by a living organism (a belief confirmed by Koch's discovery of the cholera vibrio in 1883), and included statistical surveys made during the great cholera epidemic of 1854, demonstrating that the number of cholera deaths in each area of southern London corresponded to the degree of contamination of the local drinking water. This 1855 edition was the first to tell the dramatic story of the Broad Street pump, which, after contamination with sewage from a nearby pipe, caused 500 cholera deaths within the space of ten days. Once the epidemic had peaked, Snow persuaded the parish councilors to remove the pump handle, and the number of cholera attacks decreased rapidly. Snow's report of the Broad Street epidemic included a spot-map of the district showing the location of each pump and fatal cholera cases-- the first use of a spot-map in epidemiology.--J. Norman, 2006.},

@book{Gleick1993,
abstract = {Among the most compelling environmental issues of today and tomorrow are those concerning the world's fresh water resources. Peter H. Gleick's important new volume, Water in Crisis, addresses the timely and sometimes controversial aspects of world water use. At stake are water quality, quantity, and possible future conflicts over shared international water resources. Nine essays by leading specialists from fields as diverse as hydrology, zoology, and law, among others, cover such issues as the status of developments in international water law; hydroelectric power; the possible effects of climatic change on water resources; and the state of fresh water fisheries. Particular chapters explore access to clean drinking water and sanitation; the use of water for energy and food production; the quality of rivers, lakes, and inland seas; and the condition of natural aquatic ecosystems. A joint project of the Pacific Institute and the Stockholm Environment Institute, this book is a comprehensive guide to the world's fresh water resources. Hydrologists, engineers, policy makers, professionals in the environmental sciences, as well as lay readers will find Water in Crisis a dynamic resource and information-packed reference. More than 200 tables of fresh water data supplement this important volume.},

@article{Menn1981,
abstract = {Most chemical pesticides in use today were discovered along conventional lines of research, primarily via empirical synthesis and screening followed by structure-activity relation optimization. The very rapid rise in the cost of research, the decreasing success rate for a commercial pesticide from this approach, and the ever-increasing regulatory requirements for registration suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on more rational methods for discovering new chemical pesticides. Rational leads can be discovered from several research approaches, including the synthetic modifications of natural product models, the development of metabolic disrupters or enhancers of some process in the target pests, and the development of innovative effective bioassays to discover subtle agents such as behaviour modifiers and chitin synthesis blockers. In our research programmes, we have extensively investigated juvenile hormone agonists and antagonists. These two areas probably best exemplify the biorational aspects of the discovery of highly selective insecticidal agents. One of our current goals is to develop chemical antagonists of juvenile hormone in lepidopterous larvae, which will result in biochemical and/or morphogenetic disturbances in the insect similar to those elicited by surgical removal of the corpora allata.},

abstract = {As the world's largest distributed store of fresh water, ground water plays a central part in sustaining ecosystems and enabling human adaptation to climate variability and change. The strategic importance of ground water for global water and food security will probably intensify under climate change as more frequent and intense climate extremes (droughts and floods) increase variability in precipitation, soil moisture and surface water. Here we critically review recent research assessing the impacts of climate on ground water through natural and human-induced processes as well as through groundwater-driven feedbacks on the climate system. Furthermore, we examine the possible opportunities and challenges of using and sustaining groundwater resources in climate adaptation strategies, and highlight the lack of groundwater observations, which, at present, limits our understanding of the dynamic relationship between ground water and climate.},

@article{Neumaier2012,
abstract = {The concept of DNA “repair centers” and the meaning of radiation-induced foci (RIF) in human cells have remained controversial. RIFs are characterized by the local recruitment of DNA damage sensing proteins such as p53 binding protein (53BP1). Here, we provide strong evidence for the existence of repair centers. We used live imaging and mathematical fitting of RIF kinetics to show that RIF induction rate increases with increasing radiation dose, whereas the rate at which RIFs disappear decreases. We show that multiple DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 1 to 2 $\mu$m apart can rapidly cluster into repair centers. Correcting mathematically for the dose dependence of induction/resolution rates, we observe an absolute RIF yield that is surprisingly much smaller at higher doses: 15 RIF/Gy after 2 Gy exposure compared to approximately 64 RIF/Gy after 0.1 Gy. Cumulative RIF counts from time lapse of 53BP1-GFP in human breast cells confirmed these results. The standard model currently in use applies a linear scale, extrapolating cancer risk from high doses to low doses of ionizing radiation. However, our discovery of DSB clustering over such large distances casts considerable doubts on the general assumption that risk to ionizing radiation is proportional to dose, and instead provides a mechanism that could more accurately address risk dose dependency of ionizing radiation.},

@article{Wrixon2008,
abstract = {This paper provides a review of the 2007 recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). These new recommendations take account of the latest biological and physical information and consolidate the additional guidance provided by ICRP since 1990. The changes to the scientific data are not substantial. ICRP has retained its fundamental hypothesis for the induction of stochastic effects of linearity of dose and effect without threshold and a dose and dose-rate effectiveness factor (DDREF) of 2 to derive nominal risk coefficients for low doses and low dose rates. While the overall detriment from low radiation doses has remained unchanged, ICRP has made adjustments to the values of the radiation and tissue weighting factors. In particular, the tissue weighting factor for breast has increased while that for gonads has decreased. There are some presentational changes to the system of protection. While ICRP has maintained the three fundamental principles—justification, optimisation of protection, and dose limitation—it has attempted to develop a more holistic approach to radiological protection covering all exposure situations—planned, existing and emergency—and all radiation sources, whether of natural or artificial origin. This approach should ensure that attention is focused on those exposures that can reasonably be controlled. It has also strengthened the principle of optimisation of protection with a particular emphasis on the use of constraints for planned exposure situations and reference levels for existing and emergency exposure situations. Dose constraints and reference levels are categorised into three bands which should assist in rationalising the many values of dose restrictions given in earlier ICRP publications. There are no changes to the dose limits. ICRP also indicates its intentions with respect to the development of further guidance on the protection of the environment. The fact that these new recommendations are more a matter of consolidation of previous ICRP recommendations and guidance should provide confidence that the system of protection established by and large in its present form several decades ago has reached a certain level of maturity. As such, no major changes to radiological protection regulations based on the 1990 recommendations should be necessary.},

Since the establishment of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation by General Assembly resolution 913 (X) of 3 December 1955, the mandate of the Committee has been to undertake broad assessments of the sources of ionizing radiation and its effects on human health and the environment. In pursuit of its mandate, the Committee thoroughly reviews and evaluates global and regional exposures to radiation, and also evaluates of evidence of radiation-induced health effects in exposed groups, including surviviors of the atomic bombings in Japan. The Committee also reviews advances in the understanding of the biological mechanisms by which radiation-induced effects on health or on the environment can occur. Those assessments provide the scientific foundation used, inter alia, by the relevant agencies of the United Nations system in formulating international standards for the protection of the general public and workers against ionizing radiation: those standards, in turn, are linked to important legal and regulatory instruments.},

"Preface Waste: A Handbook of Waste Management is designed to be a resource for the designer, practitioner, researcher, teacher and student. Waste is one of those entities which is defined by everyone, but not truly and completely understood by anyone. The scientist, engineer and consumer each define waste correctly, yet differently. The overriding challenge for the authors was to provide some uniformity, yet allow for the diversity of the various aspects of waste in this handbook. After all, a handbook is often the beginning of the search for information, certainly not the end. We have borrowed from all scientific disciplines, and a few humanities, to arrive at a balanced resource. And, indeed, balance is the key to environmental science and engineering"--},

abstract = {Since the advent of the modern nuclear age in the 1940’s, man has effectively managed the often hazardous waste produced by nuclear processes. Expansion of nuclear energy worldwide is likely to meet increased power demands and greenhouse gas reduction targets and will result in increased radioactive waste generation. Managing this waste effectively is a critical component of a world-wide “nuclear renaissance.” Past practice has proven the wastes generated from nuclear power generation can be effectively managed using technologies that are well demonstrated at industrial scales, with decades of safe operating practices. Emphasis is necessary to ensure that future nuclear fuel cycles remain economically and environmentally competitive (as compared to other forms of energy production) and do not produce legacy waste management issues for future generations. This chapter discusses the history of nuclear waste management and provides the current “state-of-the-art” for management of all forms of nuclear waste.
Expansion of nuclear energy worldwide is necessary to meet increased power demands and greenhouse gas reduction targets. Virtually any international energy forecast predicts large growth in nuclear power generation over the next 30–50 years. The expansion of commercial nuclear power production is likely to result in increased radioactive waste generation. Managing this waste effectively is a critical component of a worldwide nuclear renaissance and is a primary consideration for future nuclear fuel cycles. Wastes generated from nuclear power generation can be effectively managed using technologies that are well demonstrated at industrial scales, with decades of safe operating practices. As the worldwide community continues to investigate advanced nuclear fuel cycles, radioactive waste management considerations are being given increased emphasis and are, in fact, being considered at the advent of proposed fuel cycles. This emphasis is necessary to ensure that future nuclear fuel cycles remain economically and environmentally competitive (as compared with other forms of energy production) and do not produce legacy waste management issues for future generations.},

The contents detail the influence on the site of developments in nuclear science, the Cold War, environmental concerns, and domestic politics. The social and economic effects of the site on its region are also described. Numerous photographs, diagrams, and maps enrich the interesting narrative. The text includes descriptions of reactor technology and chemical separations developed at the site to improve the production of plutonium, heavy water, and tritium for the United States nuclear weapons program. The volume also includes a chronology, biographies of site managers, and an extensive set of endnotes.

The book begins with a classic account of the characteristics, progress, and political, economic and social implications of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, France and Germany. Professor Landes here raises the much-debated question: why was Europe the first to industrialise? He then charts the economic history of the twentieth-century: the effect of the First World War in accelerating the dissolution of the old international economy; the economic crisis of 1929-32; Europe's recovery and unprecedented economic growth following the Second World War. He concludes that only by continuous industrial revolution can Europe and the world sustain itself in the years ahead.},
