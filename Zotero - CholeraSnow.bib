abstract = {Wellhead-protection zones are commonly delineated on the basis of advective travel-time analysis without considering any aspects of model uncertainty. In the past decade, research efforts have produced quantifiable risk-based safety margins for protection zones. These margins are based on well-vulnerability criteria (e.g., travel times, exposure times, peak concentrations) and take model and parameter uncertainty into account. There are three main reasons why practitioners still refrain from applying these new techniques. (1) They fear the additional areal demand of probabilistic safety margins; (2) probabilistic approaches are allegedly complex, not readily available and require huge computing resources, and (3) uncertainty bounds are fuzzy, whereas final decisions are binary. The primary goal of this paper is to show that these reservations are unjustified. We present a straightforward, computationally affordable framework that offers risk-informed decision support for robust and transparent wellhead delineation under uncertainty. We show that reliability levels can be increased by exchanging delineated low-risk areas for previously nondelineated high-risk areas. We also show that further improvements may often be available with only little additional delineated area. As proof of our concept, we illustrate our key points with the example of a pumped karstic well catchment, located in Germany.},

@book{Snow1855,
abstract = {Snow expanded his reports on his cholera research in a book entitled On the Mode of Communication of Cholera published in London the same year. That book contained more statistical data confirming his theories. Over the next five years Snow continued his research, publishing a second edition of the book in 1855. This was so greatly revised and expanded that it was essentially a new work. In it Snow set forth his views of the etiology and spread of cholera, which he believed to be caused by a living organism (a belief confirmed by Koch's discovery of the cholera vibrio in 1883), and included statistical surveys made during the great cholera epidemic of 1854, demonstrating that the number of cholera deaths in each area of southern London corresponded to the degree of contamination of the local drinking water. This 1855 edition was the first to tell the dramatic story of the Broad Street pump, which, after contamination with sewage from a nearby pipe, caused 500 cholera deaths within the space of ten days. Once the epidemic had peaked, Snow persuaded the parish councilors to remove the pump handle, and the number of cholera attacks decreased rapidly. Snow's report of the Broad Street epidemic included a spot-map of the district showing the location of each pump and fatal cholera cases-- the first use of a spot-map in epidemiology.--J. Norman, 2006.},

@article{McLeod2000,
abstract = {In 1854, Dr. John Snow identified the Broad Street pump as the source of an intense cholera outbreak by plotting the location of cholera deaths on a dot-map. He had the pump handle removed and the outbreak ended\ldots or so one version of the story goes. In medical geography, the story of Snow and the Broad Street cholera outbreak is a common example of the discipline in action. While authors in other health-related disciplines focus on Snow's “shoe-leather epidemiology”, his development of a water-borne theory of cholera transmission, and/or his pioneering role in anaesthesia, it is the dot-map that makes him a hero in medical geography. The story forms part of our disciplinary identity. Geographers have helped to shape the Snow narrative: the map has become part of the myth. Many of the published accounts of Snow are accompanied by versions of the map, but which map did Snow use? What happens to the meaning of our story when the determinative use of the map is challenged? In his book On the Mode of Communication of Cholera (2nd ed., John Churchill, London, 1855), Snow did not write that he used a map to identify the source of the outbreak. The map that accompanies his text shows cholera deaths in Golden Square (the subdistrict of London's Soho district where the outbreak occurred) from August 19 to September 30, a period much longer than the intense outbreak. What happens to the meaning of the myth when the causal connection between the pump's disengagement and the end of the outbreak is examined? Snow's data and text do not support this link but show that the number of cholera deaths was abating before the handle was removed. With the drama of the pump handle being questioned and the map, our artifact, occupying a more illustrative than central role, what is our sense of Snow?},

@article{Tulodziecki2011,
abstract = {In the mid-1800s, there was much debate about the origin or ‘exciting cause’ of cholera. Despite much confusion surrounding the disease, the so-called miasma theory emerged as the prevalent account about cholera’s cause. Going against this mainstream view, the British physician John Snow inferred several things about cholera’s origin and pathology that no one else inferred. Without observing the vibrio cholerae, however,—data unavailable to Snow and his colleagues—, there was no way of settling the question of what exactly was causing cholera and how, or if, it was passed on. The question then arises as to how Snow arrived at conclusions so systematically different from those of his opponents. In this paper, I want to look at Snow’s reasoning in some detail, and show that there were certain principles, explanatory power in particular, that were epistemologically important to Snow in their own right. I will show that Snow himself takes explanatory power to be an epistemic property, and makes explicit links between explanatory power and confirmation. Systematically juxtaposing Snow’s claims and his opponents’, I will show that Snow was right to tout the explanatory power of his theory, and that his conclusions about the epistemic superiority of his theory over that of the miasmatists’ were justified.},
